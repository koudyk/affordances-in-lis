"Library, Information Science & Technology Abstracts",lxh,184921366,The influence of gamification affordance on knowledge sharing behaviour: an empirical study based on social Q&A community.,"The academic community has spent a lot of time and effort in recent years discussing the fact that gamification has a significant positive impact on encouraging user engagement behaviour. As the mainstream of current research, gamification affordance refers to the action possibilities provided by the gamified elements and features of gamified systems. However, there is a lack of research on how to improve users' knowledge sharing behaviour by introducing gamification affordances into the social question and answer (Q&A) community. This study develops a causal relationship model between gamification affordance and knowledge sharing behaviour by utilising the social Q&A community as the research object. The fundamental characteristics of gamification affordance which users value are defined through a semi-structured interview based on a focus group. The results of the structural equation model analysis on Chinese users (n = 310) demonstrate that gamification affordances enhance the gamified experience of users, thus improving user satisfaction, and ultimately affecting users' knowledge sharing behaviour. Furthermore, this study explored the important role of gamification affordance in the development of the social Q&A community and verified the significant role of gamified experience in enhancing the psychological outcomes of users. The study concludes with a discussion-worthy theoretical and practical significance.",20250501,"Wang, Xiao-Wu ; Wang, Zheng",Article,Academic Journal,May2025,true,Behaviour & Information Technology,Social media ; Focus groups ; Questionnaires ; Research methodology ; Information-seeking behavior ; China ; Intellect ; Satisfaction ; Research funding ; Interviewing ; Communities ; Descriptive statistics ; Structural equation modeling ; Social skills ; Interpersonal relations ; Gamification,JOUR,,,0144-929X,,,,,eng,Taylor & Francis Ltd,1491,1475,17,44,7,10.1080/0144929X.2024.2361059,,B6Q,,https://research.ebsco.com/linkprocessor/plink?id=3d0f60a3-edd0-31de-a493-df82db1e0deb
"Library, Information Science & Technology Abstracts",lxh,184921358,Traffic transfer between social media and E-commerce platform: the role of social media affordances.,"The traffic transfer between social media and E-commerce platforms is essential to the retailers in the E-commerce platform and the platform itself. Drawing on the affordance theory, this study presents the results from three experiments based on two kinds of social media (with or without E-commerce widow) to demonstrate the role of social media recommendation pages' affordance on the visitors' usage and sharing intention to the product link attached to the content. The result shows that traffic transfer exists between social media and E-commerce platforms. Moreover, the higher the level of social media affordances (visibility, editability, persistence, association), the higher the willingness of visitors to transfer from social media to E-commerce platforms. This change in traffic volume is mediated by the visitors' relationship strength and perceived trust in the blogger and the platform. This study expands the research on affordance theory to the area of traffic transfer. Additionally, this study has also enriched the existing literature on cross-platform traffic imports in social E-commerce. The results will guide both content operators and retailers who wish to use social media to increase sales.",20250501,"Shao, Jingbo ; Li, Pengyu ; Zhang, Min",Article,Academic Journal,May2025,true,Behaviour & Information Technology,Social media ; User interfaces ; Electronic commerce ; Consumer psychology ; Cronbach's alpha ; Research funding ; Statistical sampling ; Structural equation modeling ; Randomized controlled trials ; Descriptive statistics ; Intention ; Trust ; Mathematical models ; Theory ; Self-perception,JOUR,,,0144-929X,,,,,eng,Taylor & Francis Ltd,1375,1362,14,44,7,10.1080/0144929X.2024.2353275,,B6Q,,https://research.ebsco.com/linkprocessor/plink?id=db4dd184-88b8-3412-bc47-2c57d2b6b4a5
"Library, Information Science & Technology Abstracts",lxh,185260612,Disentangling e-commerce gamification affordances on recommendation acceptances from a perceived value perspective.,"Purpose: Gamification is a strategic approach employed by practitioners to foster meaningful engagement and enhance the acceptance of recommendations. Gamification affordances (e.g. achievement, self-expression, interaction, and cooperation) catalyze significant psychological processes in consumers, leading to behavioral changes. Despite its application, a gap remains in understanding how these gamification affordances in e-commerce contexts impact customers' perceived values and drive recommendation acceptances. Design/methodology/approach: Employing affordance theory and perceived value theory as our foundation, we have crafted a comprehensive framework that addresses the multifaceted nature of e-commerce gamification, thereby unifying the fragmented knowledge in this area. We implemented a quantitative research design to empirically test the proposed model. Findings: The research reveals that the four principal affordances of gamification – achievement, self-expression, interaction, and cooperation – significantly enrich consumer values across hedonic, utilitarian, and social dimensions. This enrichment facilitates an increased propensity for accepting recommendations. Originality/value: This study provides a novel lens through which to view the influence of gamification affordances on recommendation acceptance within gamified e-commerce settings. It delineates the effects of each affordance on consumers' perceived value and highlights the pivotal affordances that shape gamified e-commerce experiences. These insights yield actionable strategies for practitioners aiming to refine e-commerce gamification designs and cultivate more engaging consumer interactions.",20250501,"Jia, Furong ; Yu, Jie",Article,Academic Journal,2025,true,Information Technology & People,Quantitative research ; Gamification ; Electronic commerce ; Self-expression ; Consumers,JOUR,,,0959-3845,,,,,eng,Emerald Publishing Limited,1870,1843,28,38,4,10.1108/ITP-03-2023-0242,,67S,,https://research.ebsco.com/linkprocessor/plink?id=f0701a2a-083d-34cc-833a-fa5589b8f08f

However, despite the positive impact of SNS on people's lives, cyberbullying has become prevalent. Due to this prevalence, substantial research has examined cyberbullying from the perspectives of perpetrators, bystanders, and victims, but little is known about SNS users' confrontations with cyberbullying. The objectives of this study are to examine confrontation as a victim's coping response, the effect of blockability affordance on victims' protection motivation, the impact of a victim's experiences with cyberbullying perpetration, and social desirability (SD) bias in the context of cyberbullying victimization. Design/methodology/approach: This study examines the effect of blockability affordance on SNS users' protection motivation. It also investigates the relationships among perceived threat, perceived coping efficacy, and use of confrontation. Furthermore, this investigation analyzes the effect of SNS users' experiences as perpetrators on their decision to confront cyberbullies. Finally, this study assesses and controls SD bias in SNS users' confrontation behavior. To test the research model, we used an online vignette study to collect 314 data points. Findings: Blockability affordance, perceived threat, perceived coping efficacy, and cyberbullying perpetration experiences are essential factors in explaining use of confrontation. This study also finds SD bias in the context of cyberbullying victimization. Originality/value: This is one of the first studies in information systems research to empirically examine the effect of blockability affordance in the context of cyberbullying.",20250301,"Kwak, Dong-Heon ; Kim, Dongyeon ; Lee, Saerom ; Kang, Martin ; Park, Soomin ; Knapp, Deborah",Article,Academic Journal,2025,true,Internet Research,Information storage & retrieval systems ; Protection motivation theory ; Online social networks ; Cyberbullying ; Social desirability,JOUR,,,1066-2243,,,,,eng,Emerald Publishing Limited,942,912,31,35,2,10.1108/INTR-05-2023-0422,,58X,,https://research.ebsco.com/linkprocessor/plink?id=90dc2da0-f390-3372-97fe-e42caf770f9f
"Library, Information Science & Technology Abstracts",lxh,183981029,Using Digital Integrated Community Case Management to Strengthen Protocol Adherence Over the Sick Child Recording Form for Under‐Five Children Referrals From Community to Higher Level Facilities in Malawi: Affordance Perspective.,"An effective referral system at the community level of healthcare for under‐five children manages health needs by fostering relationships across all levels of healthcare, enabling patients to receive the best possible care and, in the process, saving lives. However, identifying those who need urgent referral mostly depends on community health workers (CHWs) commitment, which some studies have found inadequate due to nonadherence to the integrated Community Case Management (iCCM) Protocol, a protocol aimed at reducing child mortality and morbidity. Studies have shown that employing mobile Health (mHealth) may circumvent some of the limitations of paper‐based iCCM protocol for patient referrals, which include assessment and treatment of under‐five children. Despite the known benefits of mHealth in supporting CHWs, studies analyzing how the affordance of digital iCCM may strengthen protocol adherence over paper‐based iCCM are lacking. Therefore, the purpose of this study is to analyze how the actualization of digital iCCM may strengthen protocol adherence over the SCRF, consequently, improving referrals from the community to the higher‐level facilities for specialized treatment. The data captured from interviews, focus groups, informal chats, observation and document analysis were transcribed and analyzed using thematic analysis. We found that the Sick Child Recording Form faces challenges due to nonadherence to set guidelines, resulting in misclassification, incorrect drug prescriptions, and consequently, delays in referring patients with acute symptoms to health facilities for specialized treatment. As a contribution, this paper offers a new perspective on the technological affordances of digital iCCM that strengthen protocol adherence in patients' referrals from the community to the higher‐level facilities that include assessment and treatment.",20250301,"Matewere, Florence ; Kaasbøll, Jens Johan",Article,Academic Journal,Mar2025,true,Electronic Journal of Information Systems in Developing Countries,Virtual communities ; Health facilities ; Health information systems ; Community health workers ; Patient compliance,JOUR,,,1681-4835,,,,,eng,Wiley-Blackwell,15,1,15,91,2,10.1002/isd2.70000,,1D48,,https://research.ebsco.com/linkprocessor/plink?id=b117211e-224b-37df-a436-6d8be15f665d
"Library, Information Science & Technology Abstracts",lxh,183335456,Locating the Ethics of ChatGPT—Ethical Issues as Affordances in AI Ecosystems.,"ChatGPT is a high-profile technology that has inspired broad discussions about its capabilities and likely consequences. There has been much debate concerning ethical issues that it raises which are typically described as potentially harmful (or beneficial) consequences of ChatGPT. Concerns relating to issues such as privacy, biases, infringements of intellectual property, or discrimination are widely discussed. The article pursues the question of where these issues originate and where they are located. This article suggests that these ethical issues of the technology are located in the technology's affordances. Affordances are part of the relationship between user and technology. Going beyond existing research on affordances and ChatGPT, the article suggests that affordances are not confined to the relationship between humans and technology. A proper understanding of affordances needs to consider the role of the socio-technical ecosystem within which these relationships unfold. The article concludes by explaining the implications of this position for research and practice.",20250201,"Stahl, Bernd Carsten",Article,Academic Journal,Feb2025,true,Information,Artificial intelligence ; Intellectual property infringement ; ChatGPT ; Ecosystems ; Ethics,JOUR,,,2078-2489,,,,,eng,MDPI,,104,,16,2,10.3390/info16020104,,B74H,,https://research.ebsco.com/linkprocessor/plink?id=a31dd529-38b8-31db-9f1b-3fc4fa52d915
"Library, Information Science & Technology Abstracts",lxh,182080877,Bridging the adoption gap for cryptocurrencies: understanding the affordances that impact approach–avoidance behavior for potential users and continuation usage for actual users.,"Purpose: With the rise of cryptocurrency and its influence on the financial industry, this paper aims to explore cryptocurrency affordances that lead to approach–avoidance behavioral intentions for non-users (potential) and the intention to continue use for users (actual), drawing upon affordance theory and chasm theory. Design/methodology/approach: The authors collected data from 480 potential and actual users in Germany and used maximum likelihood structural equation modeling (ML-SEM) to analyze it. In particular, the data consisted of 301 cryptocurrency users in Germany\ the authors used ML-SEM to test the post-adoption model. Additionally, logistic regression was utilized to determine the dominant actual usage method (store of value or medium of exchange) for various cryptocurrency coins. Findings: According to the study's results, the perceived value benefits have a positive impact on the behavioral intention of potential users to adopt cryptocurrency, and they influence the intention of actual users to continue using it. However, both perceived volatility and financial risk tolerance are the most crucial factors hindering cryptocurrency adoption, whether in the pre-adoption or the post-adoption stage. Originality/value: This is the first study to reveal cryptocurrency affordances and examine their effect on behavioral intentions toward cryptocurrency adoption based on the differences between non-users (potential) and users (actual). Furthermore, the authors explore how cryptocurrency holders perceive and invest in different coins (e.g. NFTs), which sheds light on factors such as financial risk tolerance that affect their decision making.",20250101,"Armani Dehghani, Milad ; Karavidas, Dionysios ; Rese, Alexandra ; Acikgoz, Fulya",Article,Academic Journal,2025,true,Information Technology & People,Structural equation modeling ; Financial risk ; Perceived benefit ; Cryptocurrencies ; Non-fungible tokens,JOUR,,,0959-3845,,,,,eng,Emerald Publishing Limited,530,497,34,38,1,10.1108/ITP-10-2022-0821,,67S,,https://research.ebsco.com/linkprocessor/plink?id=f93afd9c-31f0-31c2-b371-4e798e9e34cd

Design/methodology/approach: Adopting self-determination theory (SDT), this study examines a model in which the four ESM affordances (i.e. visibility, association, editability and persistence) impact employee agility through the three basic psychological needs satisfaction (i.e. perceived autonomy, perceived relatedness and perceived competence) of employees. Mplus 7.4 was used to analyze survey data gathered from 304 employees who used ESM in the workplace. Findings: The authors' findings show that all four ESM affordances contribute to perceived relatedness and perceived competence; visibility and association affordances also have positive impacts on perceived autonomy; and all three psychological needs satisfaction positively impact employee agility. Originality/value: First, this study adapted SDT to explore how ESM influences employee agility. Second, this study enriches the relevant research on the antecedents of employee agility and also provides new evidence and theoretical support for employee agility.

"Library, Information Science & Technology Abstracts",lxh,180697259,Blockchain for sustainable consumption: an affordance and consumer value-based view.,"Purpose: There is little empirical evidence on how blockchain affordances may encourage consumers to make sustainable choices. Thus, this paper examines how blockchain affordances affect consumers' sustainable consumption. Design/methodology/approach: We focus on three blockchain affordances: transparency, traceability, and immutability in this paper. By integrating the affordance lens and theory of consumption values (TCV), we develop a research model wherein we posit that blockchain affordances influence several consumption values, which then affect consumers' intention to purchase sustainable products. In the study, we designed a scenario and user interface for a novel blockchain-based app for sustainable consumption in the context of the fashion industry and surveyed 295 European consumers to examine the study's research model. We then analyzed the collected data using the partial least squares technique. Findings: The results show that blockchain affordances positively affect consumption values, including efficiency, social impression, trust, and sustainability information clarity. In turn, these values influence the consumers' purchase intention of sustainable products. Additionally, our post hoc analysis shows that these consumption values fully mediate the effect of blockchain affordances on consumers' purchase intention, where trust and sustainability information clarity is found to have a higher impact. Originality/value: Empirical research studies focusing on understanding blockchain's effect on sustainable consumption values have been limited in prior literature. This study, drawing on the affordance lens, proposes distinct blockchain affordances and empirically validates their impact on consumers' sustainable purchase intention. By integrating TCV, it highlights the mediating mechanism that drives blockchain's impact on consumers' purchase intention. We empirically identify the values that mediate the effects of blockchain affordances on consumers' purchase intention; further, we discuss implications for research and practice based on the study findings.",20241201,"Hina, Maryam ; Islam, Najmul ; Dhir, Amandeep",Article,Academic Journal,2024,true,Internet Research,User interfaces ; Consumer behavior ; Sustainable consumption ; Europeans ; Trust ; Blockchains,JOUR,,,1066-2243,,,,,eng,Emerald Publishing Limited,250,215,36,34,7,10.1108/INTR-07-2023-0523,,58X,,https://research.ebsco.com/linkprocessor/plink?id=e4ddf438-1841-3dd5-9463-c5ed1e7edf41

Nevertheless, limited studies focused on the effect of AI-specific factors on user behaviour. To fill this research gap, we identified the AEILS-specific affordances (i.e. interactivity, personalisation, competition, convenience) and explored their effect on user engagement and foreign language speaking anxiety (FLSA). In this paper, we integrate quantitative and qualitative studies to explore user behaviour in AEILS. Survey data was collected from 457 respondents and analysed using structural equation modelling with the smart-PLS software. The results showed that AEILS-specific affordances significantly affect flow experience and self-expansion, thus facilitating user engagement and alleviating FLSA.

"Library, Information Science & Technology Abstracts",lxh,181232884,Implementing artificial intelligence across task types: constraints of automation and affordances of augmentation.,"Purpose: This study aims to uncover the constraints of automation and the affordances of augmentation related to implementing artificial intelligence (AI)-powered systems across different task types: mechanical, thinking and feeling. Design/methodology/approach: Qualitative study involving 45 interviews with various stakeholders in artistic gymnastics, for which AI-powered systems for the judging process are currently developed and tested. Stakeholders include judges, gymnasts, coaches and a technology vendor. Findings: We identify perceived constraints of automation, such as too much mechanization, preciseness and inability of the system to evaluate artistry or to provide human interaction. Moreover, we find that the complexity and impreciseness of the rules prevent automation. In addition, we identify affordances of augmentation such as speedier, fault-less, more accurate and objective evaluation. Moreover, augmentation affords to provide an explanation, which in turn may decrease the number of decision disputes. Research limitations/implications: While the unique context of our study is revealing, the generalizability of our specific findings still needs to be established. However, the approach of considering task types is readily applicable in other contexts. Practical implications: Our research provides useful insights for organizations that consider implementing AI for evaluation in terms of possible constraints, risks and implications of automation for the organizational practices and human agents while suggesting augmented AI-human work as a more beneficial approach in the long term. Originality/value: Our granular approach provides a novel point of view on AI implementation, as our findings challenge the notion of full automation of mechanical and partial automation of thinking tasks.

Drawing on social comparison and organisational support theory, this study explored how social media affordances influence employees' altruistic behaviours from both positive and negative perspectives. In this study, 302 employees from organisations in China were surveyed. We found that social media affordances could facilitate employees' perceived organisational support and social comparison of ability. Perceived organisational support positively mediated the relationship between social media affordances and altruistic behaviours. Although the evidence did not support the notion that social comparison of ability could directly dampen altruistic behaviours, a post-hoc analysis found that it could dampen the positive impact of perceived organisational support on developing altruistic behaviours.

"Library, Information Science & Technology Abstracts",lxh,177655988,She has got a gig: affordances of on-demand work apps for marginalised women enduring time scarcity.,"On-demand work applications (ODWAs), a type of digital platforms (DPs), are technology-enabled intermediaries for gig workers. In this paper, we study these platforms and their impact on women belonging to the low socio-economic section in a developing economy. These women act as primary unpaid workers while being expected to make an economic contribution. Hence, they suffer from time scarcity where they need to find mechanisms to generate economic success from the limited time they have, in a largely informal economy. We employed the theoretical lens of affordances to delineate the affordances that are provided by the various features of ODWAs and their impact on life satisfaction of women.

This study aimed to examine the educational affordances of music-related games through content analysis. User reviews of music gaming mobile apps and video games were collected from two major digital distribution platforms and analysed to identify patterns and meanings related to their educational affordances and learning design. The findings reflected a sense of competence, autonomy and engagement resulting from playing video games, which motivated players to become self-directed learners in the context of informal learning. Several bias and limitations were identified, suggesting that an overreliance on video games may lead to unbalanced musical growth and incomprehensive musicianship training.",20240601,"Cheng, Lee",Article,Academic Journal,Jun2024,true,"Technology, Pedagogy & Education",Mobile communication systems ; Learning ; Education ; Video games ; Music education,JOUR,,,1475-939X,,,,,eng,Taylor & Francis Ltd,345,331,15,33,3,10.1080/1475939X.2024.2319171,,131K,,https://research.ebsco.com/linkprocessor/plink?id=95cd0978-dfa6-39d9-8e3c-5a4f606d7a21

"Library, Information Science & Technology Abstracts",lxh,177901047,'Do your own research': affordance activation and disinformation spread.,"Affordances are the perception of what a technical artifact can do. They bridge a technically-determinist perspective with social constructivist theory, acknowledging the material aspects of technology while allowing for user agency. Yet most affordance theory separates out the engagement process into producers and consumers. On one hand, this lens is essential because it considers how an end user interprets, engages, and utilizes technology through their social structure. It highlights how engagement is both constrained and enabled by the creator, but also documents how such engagement might differ from a creator's intention(s) completely. On the other hand, this framework doesn't consider the interactional dimensions of affordances theory. This paper fills this gap, relying on sociotechnical theory to analyze three case studies across three different platforms (Twitter, Google Scholar, and Yandex). In doing so, we explain how pundits, propagandists, and conspiracy theorists 'activate affordances' to validate their claims. When audiences are primed to 'do their own research,' disinformation becomes a more entangled, participatory process.",20240501,"Tripodi, Francesca B. ; Garcia, Lauren C. ; Marwick, Alice E.",Article,Academic Journal,May2024,true,"Information, Communication & Society",Disinformation ; X Corp. ; Social constructivism ; Conspiracy theories ; Social structure,JOUR,,,1369-118X,,,,,eng,Taylor & Francis Ltd,1228,1212,17,27,6,10.1080/1369118X.2023.2245869,,5BA,,https://research.ebsco.com/linkprocessor/plink?id=1c157e28-f717-372f-ae9e-f6a357fe2f43
"Library, Information Science & Technology Abstracts",lxh,175988549,Informing sustainable development in education: Identification and actualization of layered IS affordances.,"This paper reports from a qualitative case study in the Gambian education sector. The study applies an affordance perspective to the ongoing strengthening of the national education management information system. Our analysis distinguishes between micro‐level technology‐use affordances (e.g., civil servants using IT for data capture and reporting), meso‐level information system (IS) affordances (e.g., data‐driven decision making at the organizational level), and macro‐level affordances, which include policy interventions to ensure the attainment of education sector goals. The contribution of the paper is twofold. First, the paper introduces a stepwise framework for IS affordance identification in terms of granularity levels (micro, meso and macro). Second, the paper outlines how use of IT at the micro‐level allows for the actualization of meso‐level IS affordances, which in turn serve as a foundation for the articulation of higher‐level interventions. Far too often, ICT for development (ICT4D) projects focus on putting technology in the hands of users with the assumption that ""better data"" will drive development. The significant work involved in identifying and actualizing meso‐level IS affordances is often not explicated and recognized in related plans and budgets. By highlighting meso‐level IS affordance actualizations, the paper explicates the link between public sector IT adoption and use and intended societal‐level impact, which remains a key policy and research concern.",20240301,"Valbø, Bjørnar ; Sanner, Terje Aksel",Article,Academic Journal,Mar2024,true,Electronic Journal of Information Systems in Developing Countries,Information resources management ; Information storage & retrieval systems ; Sustainable development ; Management education ; Civil service ; Management information systems,JOUR,,,1681-4835,,,,,eng,Wiley-Blackwell,14,1,14,90,2,10.1002/isd2.12302,,1D48,,https://research.ebsco.com/linkprocessor/plink?id=e962f33c-bce8-3b78-9131-e2d588c01543
"Library, Information Science & Technology Abstracts",lxh,174631790,A feminist-affordance lens: examining the power outcomes of the actualization of smartphone affordances.,"Purpose: The authors explore the entanglement of smartphone technology and power in this paper. This paper explores the following question: In what ways does the actualization of smartphone affordances result in empowering outcomes (i.e. increase or reduce oppression) in the daily lives of refugees? Leveraging both affordance and feminist theories, the authors develop a hybrid lens bringing attention to the contextualized relationship between social process goals and affordances for sociality, upon which the authors introduce the notion of ""goal-affordance interrelations"". The authors then trace how the actualization of these interrelations increases or reduces oppression. Design/methodology/approach: Using an abductive approach, the authors analyze 32 semi-structured interview transcriptions conducted with Syrian refugees in Lebanon. Findings: The analysis in this study reveals four categories of social process goals (meet financial needs, satisfy security needs, communicate and learn and maintain pre-existing social ties) that are intimate components of contextually meaningful affordances. When actualized, the goal–affordance interrelations fundamentally shape refugee experiences of power outcomes. The findings suggest forms of empowerment where powerlessness, marginalization, violence and exploitation are perceived to be reduced. Actualization outcomes are also found to increase perceived oppression. Additionally, the findings reveal that not all interrelations are actualized, such that the anticipation of an oppressive power outcome may limit the actualization of affordances for sociality. Originality/value: This research raises considerations concerning technology and oppression, and that efforts to empower refugees through technology should critically question whether the lived experiences of oppression will be reduced. The findings of this study reveal various forms of less empowering (i.e. oppressive) outcomes for the refugees sampled, they also point to the potential politicization of the actualization of goal–affordance interrelations.",20240101,"Salamoun, Randa ; Karam, Charlotte M. ; Abdallah, Crystel",Article,Academic Journal,2024,true,Information Technology & People,Lebanon ; Refugee children ; Feminist theory ; Feminism ; Social goals ; Social processes ; Syrian refugees ; Smartphones,JOUR,,,0959-3845,,,,,eng,Emerald Publishing Limited,80,51,30,37,1,10.1108/ITP-06-2020-0434,,67S,,https://research.ebsco.com/linkprocessor/plink?id=ab0a5d51-068f-373e-8428-da74ddfcca71

The study explored how users actualise the affordances of a mobile dating application like Tinder to fulfil their racialized dating intentions. Through a qualitative study based on 25 semi-structured interviews, four novel propositions are formulated. The study specifically contributes to affordance theory as well as theories around self-presentation, impression formation and preference disclosure. The propositions articulate how inter- and intra- racial dating intentions are supported when mediated by the actualisation of mobile dating applications affordances namely Visual Dominance, Synchronicity and Locatability.

Uncovering the underlying mechanism of addictive use is essential to address this serious issue. Design/methodology/approach: By utilizing the context of massively multiplayer online games (MMOGs), this study developed virtual-domain perfectionism of seeking excellence and avoiding failure from the dual process model of perfectionism and identified four affordances in MMOGs from the perspective of technology affordance. The authors surveyed 302 valid samples in MMOGs to empirically test the research model. Findings: The results demonstrate that two processes of virtual-domain perfectionism influence addictive use positively in MMOGs. Technology affordances perform as the antecedents of virtual-domain perfectionism and conduct distinct impacts in MMOGs. Specifically, affordances of interaction and identity are positively related to virtual-domain perfectionism, while achievement affordance is unrelated to virtual-domain perfectionism. Immersion affordance is positively related to virtual-domain perfectionism of seeking excellence and negatively associated with virtual-domain perfectionism of avoiding failure. Originality/value: This study identified virtual-domain perfectionism and specific MMOGs affordances.

"Library, Information Science & Technology Abstracts",lxh,174277043,Digital media 'changes the game': investigating digital affordances impacts on sex crime and policing in the 21st century.,"With society becoming increasingly digital, new opportunities are afforded to potential offenders to weaponize digital features and affordances to carry out their crimes. As a result, concerns persist over online forms of crime, particularly cybercrime involving sexual exploitation, and what can be done about them. Drawing on interview and focus group data collected from 70 sex crime investigators from police service organizations across Canada, we uncover police perspectives on online sex-based crime. We demonstrate that police perceive online crimes to not necessarily be new forms of crime, but rather altered by digital media in terms of methods and weapons being used. We focus on uncovering the features and affordances police identify as contributing to the increase in crime itself as well as the creation of greater opportunities for crime to occur. In addition, resulting from crime shifting into digital spaces, we uncover the challenges digital media has presented for police in terms of how they handle, respond to, and investigate online crime. We discuss these challenges and their impact on policing and provide solutions for combatting them moving forward. Overall, this article contributes to the current body of literature investigating online crime and policing in the digital age by drawing on the theoretical framework of affordances and offering police perspectives on online sex-based crimes.",20231201,"Ballucci, Dale ; Patel, Molly-Gloria",Article,Academic Journal,Dec2023,true,"Information, Communication & Society",,JOUR,,,1369-118X,,,,,eng,Taylor & Francis Ltd,2842,2825,18,26,14,10.1080/1369118X.2022.2113422,,5BA,,https://research.ebsco.com/linkprocessor/plink?id=7ae43885-adc3-324c-ba82-d5f37ec4ed41

This systematic review synthesizes AI affordances in online higher education, particularly identifying various ways AI is used throughout the online instruction cycle. We analyzed fifty-five studies focusing on publication trends, research methodology and quality, AI affordances during the design, facilitation, assessment and evaluation stages, and ethical considerations in this context. The findings revealed the applications of AI-empowered systems and Machine Learning (ML) models in various tasks such as establishing learning objectives in design, supporting cognition in facilitation, automatic grading in assessment, and measuring instruction quality in evaluation. We also discussed the trends regarding the limited incorporation of theoretical frameworks, a dominance of quantitative methods, a focus of big data, and a tendency towards personalization and adaptation. The ethical considerations were categorized for each research phase - data collection, analysis, and interpretation and usage, with an emphasis on validation approaches for AI generated outputs. These findings have implications on effectively integrating AI technologies by highlighting possibilities and competencies required for practitioners and inferring potential opportunities for researchers. • AI empowered systems and ML models are two types of applications to enhance teaching and learning in online higher education. • They support various tasks across the online instruction cycle, more on facilitation than design, assessment, and evaluation. • The dominance of big data raises ethical considerations regarding data privacy, collection, interpretation, and usage. • The promising progress towards personalization and adaptation necessitates greater integration of learning theories. • Effective adoption and integration of AI affordances require educators to possess both perceptual and technical readiness.",20251001,"Zhuang, Min ; Long, Siyu ; Martin, Florence ; Castellanos-Reyes, Daniela",Article,Academic Journal,Oct2025,true,Internet & Higher Education,Artificial intelligence ; Machine learning ; Online education ; Teaching aids ; Ethical problems ; Data privacy,JOUR,,,1096-7516,,,,,eng,Elsevier B.V.,N.PAG,N.PAG,,67,,10.1016/j.iheduc.2025.101039,,5CO,,https://research.ebsco.com/linkprocessor/plink?id=724a96fa-9275-3d19-b910-2dfdad51174e

This study investigates digital guanxi in Chinese organisations by applying technology affordance theory to explore the complementary roles of various social media platforms. Our focus is on how these platforms shape both instrumental and affective dimensions of guanxi among employees. By conducting a case study with an exploratory approach, this study presents a theoretical framework elucidating how social media influences the formation of digital guanxi in the workplace. The findings indicate that enterprise social media (ESM) features enhance identity visibility, association, and knowledge sharing, thereby promoting instrumental guanxi by facilitating identity-based trustworthiness (xinyong), understanding, reciprocity, and professional reputation. Conversely, public social media (PSM) features foster social presence, interactivity, and self-presentation, bolstering affective guanxi by enhancing affinity-based trustworthiness (xinyong), intimacy, altruism, and social image. This research provides theoretical and practical insights into the distinct pathways through which social media contributes to guanxi development, offering a comprehensive framework for grasping the diverse aspects of digital guanxi within modern organisational contexts. • ESM and PSM affordances drive both instrumental and affective guanxi development. • A model reveals complementary roles of ESM and PSM in workplace guanxi building. • ESM fosters instrumental guanxi via identity visibility, association, and knowledge sharing. • PSM supports affective guanxi through social presence, interactivity, and self-presentation.",20251001,"Hong, Jingzhu ; Tan, Barney ; Ng, Evelyn ; Davison, Robert M. ; Wong, Louie",Article,Academic Journal,Oct2025,true,International Journal of Information Management,Social influence ; Mass media influence ; Interpersonal relations ; Guanxi ; Social enterprises,JOUR,,,0268-4012,,,,,eng,Elsevier B.V.,N.PAG,N.PAG,,84,,10.1016/j.ijinfomgt.2025.102933,,1LL,,https://research.ebsco.com/linkprocessor/plink?id=27926575-0bd9-344b-8a19-e42874a48f8d

Little research has been done into the factors that motivate individuals to make records. This article uses the example of the personal records created by Bangladeshi rural women who participated in a development project to investigate the roles that personal choices and external influences play in the development of recordkeeping practices. By conducting interviews with participants after the end of the project, the author obtained some insights into the factors that encouraged them to create records during the project and the reasons why they continued or stopped doing it after the end of the project and about the role played by external actors, in particular local staff from non-governmental organisations, in influencing their recordkeeping practices. The author shows that the participants started creating and keeping records when they understood the importance that these records could have for them in the future and that the women who persevered with personal recordkeeping practices were those who were more educated and more information literate. On the other hand, the participants who wrote down information because they were encouraged to do so stopped doing it when the regular information flow ended, and they were no longer encouraged to capture information. The author argues that the factors that encourage individuals to create and keep records differ depending on the affordances that the records provide to them. Whereas external actors can play an important role in motivating people to keep records as evidence, for records that are kept for their informational content, personal motivations and recordkeeping literacy skills play a determinant role.",20240301,"Frings-Hessami, Viviane",Article,Academic Journal,Mar2024,true,Archival Science,Literacy ; Rural women ; Nongovernmental organizations ; Motivation (Psychology),JOUR,,,1389-0166,,,,,eng,Springer Nature,99,83,17,24,1,10.1007/s10502-023-09431-9,,OCL,,https://research.ebsco.com/linkprocessor/plink?id=53a63d00-0386-3be7-adb8-74e3a304991a

While previous studies have mainly investigated the effects of personal characteristics (e.g. demographics, personality traits and motivational needs) on selfie posting, the impacts exerted by individuals' social networks have been largely neglected. Drawing on the Actor-Network Theory, this study explores besides personal traits (i.e. personalities and demographics), how relational characteristics of one's ego networks (i.e. gender heterogeneity, age homophily, average tie strength, and network density) and SNSs affordances (i.e. connectivity and interactivity) affect selfie posting behavior. Based on a survey sample in which the respondents' ego network data were collected, individuals' ego-network metrics were calculated and analyzed. Our analyses show that those whose ego network having a higher proportion of opposite sex (measured by gender heterogeneity) or/and having alters more connected with one another (measured by network density) are more likely to post selfie on SNSs, while those embedded in a strong-tie network (measured by average tie strength) are less likely to post selfie on SNSs.

However, due to the phenomenological nature of the affordance concept, its application and understanding in the human-computer interaction (HCI) domain remain uncertain, resulting in limited utilization in design practice. This study introduces the concept of nested affordances, linking affordances more closely and explicitly with perception. We reposition the affordance concept and transform it into a design tool--the Affordance Interaction Matrix (AIM). This matrix captures the nested relationships and perceptual conflicts between target affordances within a product, assisting designers in identifying and eliminating potential confusion for users when facing a design, providing implicit interaction cues. The AIM-based design method proposed in this research addresses the shortcomings in describing product affordance interactions, focusing on the natural guidance of specific behaviors. This approach enables designers to clarify intuitive interaction foundations and make swift, effective decisions.

"Library, Information Science & Technology Abstracts",lxh,185748165,Stability and change in digital transformation: A repertoire model of institutionally embedded technology affordances.,"Digital transformation involves radical change—change in material technologies, certainly, but also a departure from the institutional referents that have guided organizational practice in the past. Still, even during transformation, some elements of the organizational system remain stable, and even new practices are not created out of wholecloth. Therefore, organizations must reconcile stability and change when they undergo digital transformation. We develop a ""repertoire"" model of institutionally embedded affordances that offers an institutional explanation for both stability and change of technology enactments in the context of digital transformations. The model explicitly attends to the way organizational actors construct, maintain, and alter repertoires of potential technology enactments in contemporary institutionally pluralistic contexts. Our model allows us to identify four key mechanisms of stability and change that characterize digital transformations: affordance reproduction ; technology transposition ; logic transposition ; and affordance transposition. We highlight the central role of the repertoire for navigating the pluralism of institutions and technologies in contemporary organizing. • Characterize digital transformation as an institutional process where organizations must reconcile stability and change. • Develop a repertoire model of institutionally-embedded affordances as an explanation for stability and change in digital transformation. • Identify four mechanisms of affordance reproduction; technology transposition; logic transposition; and affordance transposition.",20250601,"Seidel, Stefan ; Berente, Nicholas ; Baiyere, Abayomi",Article,Academic Journal,Jun2025,true,Information & Organization,Digital transformation ; Institutional logic ; Pluralism ; Logic ; Actors,JOUR,,,1471-7727,,,,,eng,Elsevier B.V.,N.PAG,N.PAG,,35,2,10.1016/j.infoandorg.2025.100564,,JG1,,https://research.ebsco.com/linkprocessor/plink?id=b772b974-ed3f-3e1b-b30d-4e743e79c5a4
"Library, Information Science & Technology Abstracts",lxh,163113854,How TikTok leads users to flow experience: investigating the effects of technology affordances with user experience level and video length as moderators.,"Purpose: Although the short-video-based application TikTok and its AI-enhanced technology have achieved enormous success and reshaped the user experience, few studies have focused on the user experience in the TikTok context. This study adopts a technology affordance theory lens to identify the main mechanisms contributing to the user experience in the short-video platform context while including user experience level and video length as moderating effects. Design/methodology/approach: This study collected 401 valid questionnaires from TikTok users and used the structural equation modeling approach to examine the proposed research model. Findings: Three technology affordances (perceived effortlessness, perceived recommendation accuracy, and perceived recommendation serendipity) contribute to TikTok users' optimal flow experience. Multi-group analysis results further indicate that individuals react differently to the same stimuli as their experience level increases. Finally, video length critically influences the impact of technology affordances on users' cognitive responses. Originality/value: As a burgeoning industry, the mechanisms enabling short-video platforms to engage users remain unclear to practitioners and researchers. Thus, this study's technology affordance lens provides necessary insights into how TikTok's innovative and advanced technologies contribute to user flow experience from a context-dependent perspective. Furthermore, given that most existing studies have neglected possible variations in user preferences when investigating the effects of technology, this study enriches the existing literature by employing user experience level and video length as moderators.",20230301,"Zhao, Hongying ; Wagner, Christian",Article,Academic Journal,2023,true,Internet Research,User experience ; Structural equation modeling ; Flow theory (Psychology),JOUR,,,1066-2243,,,,,eng,Emerald Publishing Limited,849,820,30,33,2,10.1108/INTR-08-2021-0595,,58X,,https://research.ebsco.com/linkprocessor/plink?id=063faaf8-cf18-3c3b-965b-22452602111d

Design/methodology/approach: The features and content of a young people's section of a popular Finnish discussion forum were examined with a focus on health-related threads. Observational notes and thread content were analysed with a focus on the forum's affordances for health information practices. Findings: The findings indicate that the forum's affordances including anonymity, persistence, searchability, cohesion and tolerance enabled the pooling of peer experiences, opinions and experience-based advice on health, rather than sharing factual information or embracing reciprocal discussion. As such, instead of competing for a cognitive authority position with medical authorities or offering emotional support like tight online support communities, the anonymous forum served as a platform for young people to gain information on others' experiences and opinions on sensitive, mundane and disnormative health issues and for reflecting their own lived experiences to those of others.

"Library, Information Science & Technology Abstracts",lxh,160312908,Open e-learning platforms and the design–reality gap: an affordance theory perspective.,"Purpose: The dropout rates of open e-learning platforms are often cited as high as 97%, with many users discontinuing their use after initial acceptance. This study aims to explore this anomaly through the lens of affordances theory, revealing design–reality gaps between users' diverse goals and the possibilities for action provided by an open IT artefact. Design/methodology/approach: A six-month case study was undertaken to investigate the design implications of user-perceived affordances in an EU sustainability project which developed an open e-learning platform for citizens to improve their household energy efficiency. Thematic analysis was used to reveal the challenges of user continuance behaviour based on how an open IT artefact supports users in achieving individual goals (e.g. reducing energy consumption in the home) and collective goals (lessening the carbon footprint of society). Findings: Based on the findings, the authors inductively reveal seven affordances related to open e-learning platforms: informing, assessment, synthesis, emphasis, clarity, learning pathway and goal-planning. The findings centre on users' perception of these affordances, and the extent to which the open IT artefact catered to the goals and constraints of diverse user groups. Open IT platform development is further discussed from an iterative and collaborative perspective in order to explore different possibilities for action. Originality/value: The study contributes towards research on open IT artefact design by presenting key learnings on how the designers of e-learning platforms can bridge design–reality gaps through exploring affordance personalisation for diverse user groups. This can inform the design of open IT artefacts to help ensure that system features match the expectations and contextual constraints of users through clear action-oriented possibilities.",20221101,"McCarthy, Stephen ; Rowan, Wendy ; Kahma, Nina ; Lynch, Laura ; Ertiö, Titiana Petra",Article,Academic Journal,2022,true,Information Technology & People,Educational technology ; Digital learning ; Thematic analysis ; Ecological impact ; Energy consumption,JOUR,,,0959-3845,,,,,eng,Emerald Publishing Limited,98,74,25,35,8,10.1108/ITP-06-2021-0501,,67S,,https://research.ebsco.com/linkprocessor/plink?id=80f0692f-8424-328b-bcf0-a5842906580c
"Library, Information Science & Technology Abstracts",lxh,160628742,Emergent affordances and potential challenges of mobile learning apps: insights from online reviews.,"Purpose: Through a data-driven theory development approach, this study builds on affordance theory and demonstrates how online mobile app reviews can be analyzed to understand the drivers of informal mobile learning success. Design/methodology/approach: Textual big data provide a wealth of information regarding user–app relationships and various facets of user engagement. Adopting structural topic modeling and sentiment analysis, the authors extract latent topics from reviews of two educational apps: Duolingo and Photomath. Findings: The findings suggest that the quality of the relationship between users and mobile learning apps is significantly reliant on how underlying affordances have been actualized. While affordances can leverage satisfaction, they may also be a source of frustration in case of any failure in their design or integration. The analysis reveals eight emergent affordances: practicality, affordability, information reliability, instruction integrity, hedonic experience, user-friendliness, interactive input and iterative upgrading. Research limitations/implications: Since affordances of a technology entail both enablement and constraint and are best studied as a bundle of connected elements influencing each other reciprocally, the authors discuss how to address potential challenges from technical aspects to the added value of using mobile learning apps. Originality/value: The results demonstrate that qualitative information in online reviews about mobile learning app experiences is of significant value.

"Library, Information Science & Technology Abstracts",lxh,160532991,Uncovering the affective affordances of videoconference technologies.,"Purpose: The purpose of this study is to examine the role of videoconferencing technologies for mediating and transforming emotional experiences in virtual context. Design/methodology/approach: Drawing on empirical data of video conferencing experiences, this study identifies different constitutive relations with technology through which actors cope with actual or potential anxieties in virtual meetings. It draws on the phenomenological-existential tradition (Sartre and Merleau-Ponty) and on an interpretive phenomenological analysis (IPA) to conceptualize and illustrate the role of affective affordances in virtual settings. Findings: The study identifies four different body–technology–other relations that provide different action possibilities, both disclosing and concealing, for navigating emotional experiences in virtual encounters of mutual gazing. These findings offer insights into the anatomy of virtual emotions and provide explanations on the nature of Zoom fatigue (interactive exhaustion) and heightened feelings of self-consciousness resulting from video conferencing interactions. Originality/value: This paper builds on and extends current scholarship on technological affordances, as well as emotions, to suggest that technologies also afford different tactics for navigating emotional experiences. Thus, this paper proposes the notion of affective affordance that can expand current information system (IS) and organization studies (OS) scholarship in important ways. The focus is on videoconference technologies and meetings that have received little research attention and even less so from a perspective on emotions. Importantly, the paper offers nuanced insights that can advance current research discourse on the relationships between technology, human body and emotions.",20221001,"Vidolov, Simeon",Article,Academic Journal,2022,true,Information Technology & People,Videoconferencing ; Affect (Psychology) ; Emotions ; Emotional experience ; Human body ; Gaze,JOUR,,,0959-3845,,,,,eng,Emerald Publishing Limited,1803,1782,22,35,6,10.1108/ITP-04-2021-0329,,67S,,https://research.ebsco.com/linkprocessor/plink?id=52eff7da-4f53-330e-ae49-f0a87e264c32

Digital media may provide the communication platforms on which supporters deliberate movement goals, share information, discuss tactics, and generate discourses in response to ongoing happenings. Yet digital media's capability to serve these functions should depend on platform-specific affordances and movement dynamics. Based on such premises, this article examines how the online forum LIHKG became the central communication platform in the Anti-Extradition Bill Movement in Hong Kong. Empirically, digital media and content analysis data help establish the forum's prominence during the first few months of the movement, while analyses of protest onsite survey data show how the use of LIHKG systematically related to several movement-related attitudes among the protesters.

A multimethod research approach was utilised that integrated ethnographic and statistical methods. Qualitative study confirmed the general structure of affordance framework, while also revealing relational structures with other variables to explore. Based on the affordance factors identified from the ethnographic methods, a survey questionnaire was created to map and investigate the effects of affordance on the user's cognitive processes and the influence of affordance on the gameplay process.

However, it remains unclear what motivates consumers to adopt health information in hedonic applications when they have alternative choices of more formal health information sources. Building on the self-determination theory and the affordances lens, this study aims to investigate how different affordances on hedonic social applications affect consumers' basic psychological needs and further influence their intention to adopt health information on such applications. Design/methodology/approach: As TikTok demonstrated great potential in disseminating health information, we developed a model that we analyze using the PLS-SEM technique with data collected from a valid research sample of 384 respondents with health information seeking or encountering experience in TikTok. Findings: The results suggested that health information adoption in hedonic social applications is significantly predicted by the satisfaction of consumers' basic psychological needs, namely autonomy, relatedness and competence. Moreover, the satisfaction of basic psychological needs is positively affected by affordances provided by the hedonic social applications. The hedonic affordances positively influence autonomy satisfaction, while the connective affordances positively affect relatedness satisfaction, and the utilitarian affordances positively support competence satisfaction. Originality/value: The study indicates that hedonic social applications such as TikTok could be an important channel for consumers to access and adopt health information. The study contributes to the literature by proposing a theoretical model that explains consumers' health information adoption and yields practical implications for designers and service providers of hedonic social applications.",20220701,"Song, Shijie ; Zhao, Yuxiang Chris ; Yao, Xinlin ; Ba, Zhichao ; Zhu, Qinghua",Article,Academic Journal,2022,true,Journal of Documentation,Information-seeking behavior ; Information resources ; Self-determination theory ; Customer satisfaction ; Autonomy (Psychology),JOUR,,,0022-0418,,,,,eng,Emerald Publishing Limited,911,890,22,78,4,10.1108/JD-08-2021-0158,,GRF,,https://research.ebsco.com/linkprocessor/plink?id=a682e71b-9da6-33c4-ac6e-8e37ac732798

However, the technological affordance of digital platforms in SSA has received very little attention in literature review. This paper presents an analytical review of the technological affordances of digital platforms in SSA. We adopted a systematic literature review methodology that entailed gathering evidence from relevant literature and digital platforms in three countries in SSA (South Africa, Nigeria, and Kenya). Three research questions focusing on (i) critical issues of discussion on digital platforms in SSA and their distribution; (ii) understanding the technological affordances of digital platforms in SSA; and (iii) assessing the extent to which the technological affordances digital platforms can address the challenges of the informal sector in SSA drove the investigation. The study developed an affordances criteria framework, the first of its kind, to evaluate digital platforms affordances in SSA. Our findings revealed the key topics that have gained researchers' attention so far and digital platforms distribution in SSA. We also found that most digital platforms in SSA currently lack affordances that support multimodal interface and native language contents, limiting their accessibility to persons with minimal digital literacy. Most platforms also lack support for public/private partnerships. The lack of critical affordances that match the profile of the informal sector in SSA makes existing digital platforms incapable of addressing many critical challenges of the informal sector. These challenges include low literacy levels, minimal/lack of government support, lack of electricity or expensive power supply, expensive internet connectivity, and health and safety issues. However, existing digital platforms can reasonably address the absence of social protection, lack of formalization, and poor operational infrastructure. As a contribution, this paper offers a new perspective on the technological affordances of digital platforms in SSA. It also provides insight into the imperatives for designing inclusive and accessible digital platforms for the informal sector in SSA.",20220701,"Daramola, Olawande ; Etim, Ernest",Article,Academic Journal,Jul2022,true,Electronic Journal of Information Systems in Developing Countries,Digital technology ; Computer literacy ; Health literacy ; Sub-Saharan Africa ; Kenya ; Nigeria ; Informal sector ; Electricity safety ; Power resources ; Government aid ; User-generated content,JOUR,,,1681-4835,,,,,eng,Wiley-Blackwell,21,1,21,88,4,10.1002/isd2.12213,,1D48,,https://research.ebsco.com/linkprocessor/plink?id=30aa5f48-e828-32a6-9f86-5e4bcd58bc3b
"Library, Information Science & Technology Abstracts",lxh,158633108,Examining user engagement and use of fitness tracking technology through the lens of technology affordances.,"The promise of fitness tracking technology in promoting positive health behaviours lies in its ability to allow users to track their physical activity, receive personalised feedback, and connect with other users. Previous studies have examined predictors of fitness tracker use and antecedents of user engagement. However, little is known about how technology affordances of fitness trackers motivate individuals to engage with the technology and whether the engagement can lead to fitness tracker use. Guided by the Motivational Technology Model (MTM) and Self-Determination Theory (SDT), this study examines the interplay among technology affordances (interactivity, navigability, and customisation) and psychological needs (relatedness, competence, and autonomy) to predict engagement with and use of fitness trackers. Using a sample of 970 American adults, we found that technology affordances significantly increased individuals' sense of autonomy, competence, and relatedness, which in turn led to increased engagement with and use of fitness trackers. Among the three technology affordances, customisation had a direct effect on user engagement.

(2017): the measurement of social media affordances.,"In a recent issue of Journal of Communication, Rice et al. (2017) offered a measure of social media affordances that has been of decided value to its corpus. Specifically, using a grounded-theory approach, these authors predicted the existence of 11 unique affordances that are manifest within organisational contexts. However, based on exploratory factor analysis, these authors contend that only 6 unique affordances were emergent in their data. Using alternate statistical methods (i.e. confirmatory factor analysis) and newly collected data from two different samples, we show that Rice et al.'s initial 11-factor measurement model provides a good fit to the data. In addition, subsequent analyses show that the measured affordances are largely measuring the same construct (i.e. they are empirically indistinguishable). Additional analyses were also performed to show that both first- and second-order portions of the model remained invariant between different social-media platforms. In the main, these findings suggest a more parsimonious theoretical conceptualisation of the affordances construct as is used in social media contexts, i.e. the possibility of connecting to others online in a social and strategic manner. Moreover, this conceptualisation remains equivalent across different social media platforms.",20220501,"Manata, Brian ; Spottswood, Erin",Article,Academic Journal,May2022,true,Behaviour & Information Technology,Social media ; Surveys ; Factor analysis ; Information technology ; United States ; Structural equation modeling ; Social support ; Empathy ; Grounded theory ; Chi-squared test ; Employment ; Descriptive statistics ; Psychological stress,JOUR,,,0144-929X,,,,,eng,Taylor & Francis Ltd,1336,1323,14,41,6,10.1080/0144929X.2021.1875264,,B6Q,,https://research.ebsco.com/linkprocessor/plink?id=0960291a-68a1-30e7-a859-0d2399ce99c7

"Library, Information Science & Technology Abstracts",lxh,179461476,Social media affordances in sense-making and knowledge transfer.,"Background: Social media (SM) affordances and knowledge transfer (KT) culture permit sense-making, sense-unmaking and insights into an organisational performance improvement strategy. The article provides an analysis of SM affordances and how they enable sense-making. Objectives: The purpose of this article was to explore how SM can facilitate effective KT in an innovative business environment (IBE). The question inspiring the article is: How can the use of SM facilitate effective KT in an IBE? Method: Twenty online interviews with experts from various organisations were used to gather qualitative data and make sense of the key concepts. Data extracted were thematically analysed using ATLAS.ti software. Results: Mainstream academia concentrates more on the operational usefulness of SM, and not much is concentrating on how SM affordances facilitate social, organisational sense-making and KT from strategic level expert's perspective other than the operational level. Conclusion: Social media affordances are in the form of media richness, cost reduction, the meta-knowledge in community of practice, conversation frame-clues interlink, creativity, editability and creativity. The conversation leads to productive dialogue (PD) and KT. Contribution of the research: The sense-making theory enables reconceptualisation of how SM affordances facilitate social, organisational sense-making and KT.

However, it is still unclear how short video apps might facilitate and benefit users' consumption of health information. Furthermore, the technology features of short video apps complicate attempts to conduct research about them; as a consequence, they have been understudied. For addressing these concerns, this study adopts an affordance perspective to investigate the relationship between affordances and user experience and to examine factors that contribute to users' intention to continue using short video apps to obtain health information. Design/methodology/approach: Drawing upon affordance theory, we constructed a research model that integrates four types of affordances (livestreaming, searching, meta-voicing and recommending), three types of user experience (immersion, social presence and credibility perception), and user's intention to continue use. We employed an online survey and obtained a sample of 372 valid responses from TikTok (DouYin) users in China. The partial least squares (PLS) method was used to analyze the data. Findings: The study found that the user experience, in terms of social presence, immersion and credibility perception, can significantly predict users' intention to continue using short video apps to obtain health information. Furthermore, the user experience was positively associated with the different affordances provided by the short video apps. Originality/value: The findings of this study have several implications. First, the study contributes to the health information behavior literature by incorporating the aspect of user experience. Moreover, the study extends the application of affordance theory to users' health information acquisition, and it carries some practical implications on how to leverage the great potential of short video apps to serve public health communication better.",20211101,"Song, Shijie ; Zhao, Yuxiang Chris ; Yao, Xinlin ; Ba, Zhichao ; Zhu, Qinghua",Article,Academic Journal,2021,true,Internet Research,Information resources ; Information-seeking behavior ; Mobile apps ; Social media ; China ; User experience ; Health behavior,JOUR,,,1066-2243,,,,,eng,Emerald Publishing Limited,2142,2120,23,31,6,10.1108/INTR-10-2020-0593,,58X,,https://research.ebsco.com/linkprocessor/plink?id=d78fcd8b-6d7a-324f-9147-f26816bf8df9
"Library, Information Science & Technology Abstracts",lxh,152096788,Beyond platform-centrism and digital universalism: the relational affordances of mobile social media publics.,"In debates on digital affordances, mobile devices and social media platforms are often treated as separate (physical or digital) objects which function independently from each other and from the environments in which they are used ('platform-centrism'). However, mobile phone use has increasingly been dominated by social media apps while social media are frequently accessed via mobile devices, particularly in Global South contexts where users often rely on mobile-only internet access via subsidized/zero-rated social media data bundles. Furthermore, the affordances of mobile social media are shaped by the physical, mediated and political contexts in which they are used. Technological affordances are far from universal ('digital universalism') but take on different shapes across the globe. Drawing on research carried out during the September 2011 Zambian elections, this article introduces the notion of 'relational affordance' to emphasize the interplay between mobile social media, users and their varied contexts. Despite the relatively low number of mobile internet users at the time, the Facebook group of the popular, privately-owned Zambian television station, Muvi TV, quickly emerged as a fast-paced forum for the sharing of information on the elections. Three 'relational affordances' – infrastructure, home-based access and temporality – help to explain the emergence of this active mobile social media public. This analysis challenges previous accounts of mobile social media publics which identified negative (constraining) affordances like the control exerted by Facebook page administrators and positive (enabling) affordances such as the 'always-on' nature of mobile social media use and their 'on-the-go' access in public spaces.",20210915,"Willems, Wendy",Article,Academic Journal,Sep2021,true,"Information, Communication & Society",Social media ; Wireless Internet ; Zambia ; Meta Platforms Inc. ; Public spaces ; Internet access ; Developing countries ; Television stations ; Cell phones,JOUR,,,1369-118X,,,,,eng,Taylor & Francis Ltd,1693,1677,17,24,12,10.1080/1369118X.2020.1718177,,5BA,,https://research.ebsco.com/linkprocessor/plink?id=ad61e5bc-70f5-35fb-95e6-47fefaf25ed4

However, this issue has received limited research attention in the information system (IS) discipline. Drawing on the stimulus–organism–response (SOR) framework, this study explores the engagement–addiction dilemma in the use of mobile games and highlights the impacts of game design features, namely, mobile user interface and mobile game affordance. Design/methodology/approach: The research model was empirically validated using a longitudinal survey data from 410 mobile game users in China. Findings: The empirical results offer several key findings. First, mobile user interface and mobile game affordance positively affect telepresence and social presence, which lead to meaningful engagement and mobile game addiction. Second, a high-quality of mobile user interface positively moderates the effects of mobile game affordance on telepresence and social presence.

"Library, Information Science & Technology Abstracts",lxh,152228665,Novice researchers' perspectives on affordances in ICT4D research collaboration.,"Collaboration is fundamental to progress in the field of information and communication technologies for development (ICT4D) research where interdisciplinary teams are involved in the requirements elicitation, design, implementation and evaluation of context‐sensitive digital solutions. Research collaboration harbors the potential for knowledge exchange, improving research impact and human development; it is often a requirement in grant applications for funding. Despite the known benefits and incentives, there is evidence that research collaborations between African countries are lacking compared to those with and between other geographic regions. Furthermore, research collaboration has been studied as a variable but theorisation of the concept is lacking. Therefore, the purpose of this paper is to theorize research collaboration as an object with affordances based on the perspective of novice researchers (master's, doctoral and postdoctoral students) in South Africa. The data capturing from a survey and focus groups with ICT4D novice researchers from different universities in South Africa produced 39 responses to be captured, transcribed and analyzed with Atlas.ti 8 using thematic analysis. The main contribution is the theorisation of research collaboration as an object with properties and then an investigation of the affordances offered to novice researchers together with the facilitating conditions and conversion factors influencing the actualisation of those affordances. The practical contribution is the insight gained into the perspectives of novice researchers as representatives of the future generation of research collaborators.",20210901,"Mwapwele, Samwel Dick ; van Biljon, Judy",Article,Academic Journal,Sep2021,true,Electronic Journal of Information Systems in Developing Countries,Digital communications ; Information & communication technologies for development ; South Africa ; Elicitation technique ; Thematic analysis,JOUR,,,1681-4835,,,,,eng,Wiley-Blackwell,22,1,22,87,5,10.1002/isd2.12177,,1D48,,https://research.ebsco.com/linkprocessor/plink?id=478dc734-e6ed-3a84-821c-63fedd73e796

Design/methodology/approach: The authors hypothesize that social media affordances will have a positive impact on social media overload (i.e. information and communication overload). They also hypothesize that social media overload will affect social media fatigue. In addition, they hypothesize that multitasking computer self-efficacy will attenuate the effect of social media affordances on both information overload and communication overload. Similarly, they also hypothesize that multitasking computer self-efficacy will attenuate the effects of both information overload and communication overload on fatigue. The authors test this model by collecting two-wave data from 220 professionals using PLS techniques. Findings: Social media affordances have significant impacts on information overload, but not on communication overload. In turn, information overload and communication overload significantly affect social media fatigue. Multitasking computer self-efficacy was found to attenuate the effect of social media affordances on both information overload and communication overload. Furthermore, the study results suggest that multitasking computer self-efficacy attenuates the effect of information overload and reinforces the effect of communication overload on social media fatigue. Originality/value: Most prior literature focused on students rather than on professionals. There is a lack of research that investigates how the affordances of social media relate to social media overload and fatigue. Furthermore, research that investigates mitigating mechanisms of social media fatigue has been rare. This paper fills these important research gaps.",20210901,"Islam, A.K.M.

Adopting a gender perspective and a socio-technical framework, it describes how dating app affordances support the performance of gender scripts and explores how users negotiate gender scripts. We conducted 8 focus groups involving 39 dating app users from a variety of gender and sexual orientations. The results show how shared usage norms and practices disclose dominant gender scripts at play, and illustrate how some users try to subvert them. Participants are aware of a number of traditional and stereotypical gender scripts and broadly adhere to them; nevertheless, such scripts are partially reframed in the context of dating apps. Dating apps are mainly understood in terms of affordances, when participants highlight the ways in which they or their mates reduce the incidence of traditional scripts. On the other hand, dating apps' constraints emerge when some users try to detach themselves from common scripts, or when they struggle to perform traditional scripts in a context they perceive as inadequate. Results highlight how dating app users negotiate gender scripts: affordances and constraints of dating apps shape user practices and influence the performance and 'de-inscription' of gender scripts, without directly fostering the adoption of alternative scripts.",20210615,"Comunello, Francesca ; Parisi, Lorenza ; Ieracitano, Francesca",Article,Academic Journal,Jun2021,true,"Information, Communication & Society",Mobile apps ; Focus groups ; Gender ; Scripts ; Sexual orientation,JOUR,,,1369-118X,,,,,eng,Taylor & Francis Ltd,1156,1140,17,24,8,10.1080/1369118X.2020.1787485,,5BA,,https://research.ebsco.com/linkprocessor/plink?id=4f797751-d637-3ec5-914e-dc1986205d66

To realize this potential, it is imperative to illuminate why and how people use these new platforms to accomplish their goals. Using affordance theory as a guiding tool, this study aims to uncover the underlying goal directed affordances and actualization techniques used by MFS users in Bangladesh. The data are collected through in‐depth interviews with MFS users and analyzed using thematic analysis to uncover affordances along with actualization techniques that are embedded in everyday social contexts of the users. The study finds that users in their attempts to accomplish specific goals uncover various latent affordances of MFS platforms such as financial services accessibility, self‐controlling ability, spatial and temporal mobility, disintermediation ability, self‐sustainability, secrecy maintainability, and networkability, and employ several techniques to actualize those affordances.

This study focuses on the roles of three social gamification affordances (interactivity, cooperation and competition) in gamified green IT services use, from the perspectives of recognition and social overload. Design/methodology/approach: An online survey is conducted to examine the research model using structural equation modeling with users of Ant Forest, which is an example of green IT services in China. Findings: Results indicate that interactivity, cooperation and competition can positively affect recognition, which further positively affects green IT services use; however, interactivity and cooperation can increase social overload, which negatively affects green IT services use. Originality/value: This study provides new insights into the effects of social gamification affordances in green IT services by investigating the effects of interactivity, cooperation and competition on recognition and social overload.

"Library, Information Science & Technology Abstracts",lxh,149245634,Building brand loyalty and endorsement with brand pages: integration of the lens of affordance and customer-dominant logic.,"Purpose: Numerous companies have launched brand pages (BPs) on social networking sites to enhance customer-brand communication, cultivate the customer-brand relationship and promote brand loyalty. This study aims to investigate how BP affordances support social commerce. Design/methodology/approach: The study devises a theoretical model linking the proposed BP affordances (visibility, selectivity, persistence and interactivity) to three customer values (relationship quality, brand experience and smart shopping feeling [SSF]) to encourage brand loyalty and BP endorsement on the part of the customer. Findings: Data collected from 591 respondents support all proposed hypotheses. The model explains high variances in brand loyalty and BP endorsement, indicating that relationship quality plays a more salient role in producing brand loyalty, while SSF plays a more important role in eliciting BP endorsement. Originality/value: The study is unique in four ways. First, drawing on the lens of affordance, it proposes specific affordances for BPs and offers empirical results for their applicability. Second, by incorporating CDL into the research model, it illuminates the high explanatory power of these proposed BP affordances on the three customer values. Integrating the S-O-R model with the affordance perspective and CDL provides a more complete picture of the BP phenomenon. Third, it extends the reach of existing work by examining BP endorsement in social media as a dependent variable beyond brand loyalty, with SSF included as another source of values to shed more light on the relationships depicted in the model.

"Library, Information Science & Technology Abstracts",lxh,147753900,"Affordances for information practices: theorizing engagement among people, technology, and sociocultural environments.","Purpose: In the domain of information science, affordance is a relatively new concept that deserves further exploration. It may serve as a bridge to narrow the research-practice gap that has persisted in information studies. Building upon previous research, we call for a broader concept of affordance that would help researchers understand information practices from an ecological perspective. Design/methodology/approach: The study focuses on conceptualizing affordances for information practices in order to theorize engagement among people, technology, and sociocultural environments. We develop a hierarchical model and a component model to illustrate how key tenets of affordances can be linked with the decomposition of activities and its mechanism. Following this, we describe an illustrative case of a popular Chinese cloud-based music platform to demonstrate the utility of our conceptual frameworks in guiding studies of information practices. Findings: The study proposes to shift the focus of technology affordances, which highlights the features and functions of particular technologies, to the affordances for practices that are enacted through technology and social construction within a sociocultural environment. The illustrative case of the cloud-based music platform shows that the proposed models can provide a structured view of operations, actions and motives for music information practices. The processes of internalization and externalization offer insight into the decomposition of information practice as a chain of activity-action-operation.

"Library, Information Science & Technology Abstracts",lxh,144205501,The effects of security and traceability of blockchain on digital affordance.,"Purpose: This study takes an affordance approach to explain how users perceive the affordance of user action within blockchain and examines how it influences the subsequent user experience. Focusing on the effect of trust on cognitive processes, the authors analyze how affordances in blockchains affect the user experience. Design/methodology/approach: The blockchain affordances are examined through a two-stage process. The authors employ a qualitative analysis based on insights gained from the current literature and interviews. The authors then apply a quantitative survey to examine the role of trust in interactions with blockchain services. A structural user model was tested in which their appreciation of affordances of blockchain predicted the trust and satisfaction. Findings: Users' appreciation for transparency and reliability explained to what extent they trust and are satisfied, thereby suggesting the heuristic roles of trust in blockchains. The study findings indicate a heuristic role for trust regarding underlying links to technological and affective affordances. A user's cognitive heuristics affect their attitudes toward blockchain, in which technological features are processed through users' perceptions and experience. Research limitations/implications: The model contributes to the conceptualization of security, privacy and traceability along with trust, which is then linked to transparency and reliability. The findings show how the frame of affordances gains explanatory power by being linked to the concepts of affect and emotion. The heuristics of direct perception of security–traceability–privacy (STP) can be used to understand the trajectory of heuristics and ongoing choices of blockchain. Practical implications: The study results offer a lens through which to address the technology's most common problems by pairing user experience principles and heuristics to blockchain technologies. This study offers insights into the understanding of user actions related to blockchains and into practical implications for developing trust-based services. The results guide the application and tailoring of motivational affordances in blockchain. Originality/value: While blockchain technology has gained popularity and momentum, there has been little research on how specific features of blockchain technology create value.

"Library, Information Science & Technology Abstracts",lxh,141218899,How do enterprise social media affordances affect social network ties and job performance?,"Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to investigate how four enterprise social media (ESM) affordances (visibility, association, editability and persistence) affect social network ties (instrumental and expressive), which, in turn, influence the in-role and innovative job performance of employees. Design/methodology/approach: A survey of 251 ESM users in the workplace in China was conducted. Findings: All four affordances are positively associated with instrumental ties, yet only the association and editability affordances are positively related to expressive ties. Although instrumental and expressive ties are positively related to in-role and innovative job performance, instrumental ties exert stronger effects on in-role job performance, whereas expressive ties show stronger effects on innovative job performance. Research limitations/implications: First, additional relevant affordances should be included in an expanded model. Second, future research could examine how patterns of affordances use (unrelated, or hierarchically or sequentially related) affect organizational network ties. Third, there are likely (many) other exogenous factors affecting the model's relationships. Fourth, the data collected are self-reported. Practical implications: This study advances the theoretical understanding of the role of ESM affordances in the workplace, especially through their influences on network ties. The findings can guide organizations on how to emphasize ESM affordances to foster instrumental and expressive ties to improve the job performance of employees. Originality/value: First, it provides novel views on affordance theory in ESM contexts by empirically testing four central affordances, thereby further providing preliminary evidence for prior theoretical propositions by confirming that social media affordances might be associated with or influence relational ties. Second, the study integrates an affordance lens and a social network perspective to investigate employees' perceived performance behavior. Including social network ties can offer a more detailed understanding of the underlying processes of how ESM affordances can and do affect job performance. Third, it supports the validity of distinguishing instrumental and expressive ties in ESM contexts, thus offering a possible explanation for the inconsistencies in prior research on the impact of social networks on employee outcomes. Finally, it also shows how two kinds of organizational performance (in-role and innovative) are somewhat differentially influenced by affordances and network ties.",20200101,"Chen, Xiayu ; Wei, Shaobo ; Davison, Robert M. ; Rice, Ronald E.",Article,Academic Journal,2020,true,Information Technology & People,Social media ; China ; Job performance ; Social enterprises ; Social science research ; Employee affinity groups ; Social networks ; Hyacinthoides ; Social media in business,JOUR,,,0959-3845,,,,,eng,Emerald Publishing Limited,388,361,28,33,1,10.1108/ITP-11-2017-0408,,67S,,https://research.ebsco.com/linkprocessor/plink?id=034c9d46-98bb-323a-93d2-6019787cd01d

"Library, Information Science & Technology Abstracts",lxh,135147255,Contested affordances: teachers and students negotiating the classroom integration of mobile technology.,"This paper extends an emerging approach emphasizing contextual variation in the affordances of digital technologies and new media through an empirical application focused on relational dynamics of power and resistance. Specifically, I focus on the case of student and teacher negotiations over smartphones and social media in the classroom ‒ a case where actors on either side of a power relationship assign conflicting meanings to the same technology. Interviews were conducted with 37 students and 19 teachers at a public high school with a technology policy designating students' personally-owned smartphones as educational devices. As the affordance of contextual mobility allowed students to access shared online social spaces within the classroom, smartphones threatened the cultural logic of separation bounding the social from the educational. With their sense of control threatened, teachers sought to re-constitute separation through strategies of restriction and differentiation.

"Library, Information Science & Technology Abstracts",lxh,135199267,Online boundary work tactics: an affordance perspective.,"Studies of work/life balance have focussed on offline settings, and even though technology is considered as a boundary‐influencing feature, social media have not been the focus. Social technologies challenge the relationship between work and private life in new ways, due to their identified affordances: visibility, persistence, association and editability (Treem and Leonardi, 2012). In this paper, we present the results of a study of social media use (Facebook and Twitter) by employees of non‐governmental organisations (NGOs), and show how, through their affordances, these technologies influence the relationship and boundaries between work and non‐work, increasing visibility and reducing individual privacy. Consequently, we observe boundary work tactics that aim to protect private life from both public and professional scrutiny, in prohibitive, reactive or active ways. Our results call for organisations to develop explicit policies or guidelines for social media use, in both their own interests and those of their employees.",20190301,"Siegert, Steffi ; Löwstedt, Jan",Article,Academic Journal,Mar2019,true,"New Technology, Work & Employment",Social media ; Work-life balance ; Online social networks ; Nongovernmental organization personnel ; Self-control,JOUR,,,0268-1072,,,,,eng,Wiley-Blackwell,36,18,19,34,1,10.1111/ntwe.12126,,1ND,,https://research.ebsco.com/linkprocessor/plink?id=55c13fbc-6a3f-3ff3-9405-701808a9ac25
"Library, Information Science & Technology Abstracts",lxh,176546665,Adopting emerging information technology: A new affordances process framework.,"The adoption of emerging IT in organizations often involves dealing with high levels of uncertainty. In response to this challenge, we propose a framework that combines affordances theory and the resource orchestration process to explain the steps that organizations take to actualize the affordances of emerging IT. Our framework is supported by empirical data gathered from three case studies involving organizations that implemented big data analytics (BDA). We introduce a novel phase in the affordances process called affordances preparation. This phase occurs between affordances perception and affordances actualization and explains how organizations bridge the gap between their existing capabilities and resources and those required to use emerging IT, such as BDA. During this preparation stage, the organizations studied engaged in orchestration processes that combined external and internal resources and technologies, creating autonomous organizational structures to implement BDA. Additionally, these organizations invested in training, consulting, and outsourcing, embracing new development methods within multidisciplinary teams with user involvement. These actions resulted in the cultural changes necessary for fostering a data-driven culture in these organizations. • Examines emergent IT adoption via Affordances and Resource Orchestration. • Explain how organizations generate capabilities to adopt emergent IT. • Propose a preparation stage in the affordances process. • Reveal nonlinear causal-temporal relationships in affordances process. • Provides insights on how organizations can prepare to adopt emergent IT.",20240601,"Strauss, Luisa Mariele ; Klein, Amarolinda Zanela ; Scornavacca, Eusebio",Article,Academic Journal,Jun2024,true,International Journal of Information Management,Information technology ; Big data ; Organizational structure ; Corporate culture ; Data analytics,JOUR,,,0268-4012,,,,,eng,Elsevier B.V.,N.PAG,N.PAG,,76,,10.1016/j.ijinfomgt.2024.102772,,1LL,,https://research.ebsco.com/linkprocessor/plink?id=2e0ad19f-213b-39bc-8d2e-607bb89bf736
"Library, Information Science & Technology Abstracts",lxh,130910930,Social tie formation in Chinese online social commerce: The role of IT affordances.,"Social media technology creates an opportunity to shift the formation of impersonal relationships from offline to online. The theory of IT affordances provides a basis for theorizing how the use of online social commerce (OSC) technology facilitates the formation of social ties in an OSC context. In this paper, integrating theories of IT affordances and social ties, we develop a model to explore how the six sub-dimensions of OSC IT affordances (i.e., visibility, metavoicing, triggered attending, guidance shopping, social connecting, and trading) aid buyers and sellers in building strong and weak OSC ties. A survey of 511 buyers from WeChat shows that five of the six IT affordances enhance the quality of interactivity, and thereby facilitate social ties (both strong and weak), which in turn contribute to buyers’ repurchase intentions. Additionally, the findings confirm the positive moderating effect of perceived effectiveness of e-commerce institutional mechanisms (PEEIM) on the strong tie formation process. This paper advances the affordances and social tie literature by examining the antecedents and outcomes of OSC social ties in more detail.

Thanks to technological advances in recent decades, governments can instantly reach citizens through multiple channels. Existing research on emergency messaging indicates that the effectiveness of messaging depends on multiple factors, including receivers' characteristics, message content and style, as well as the social and political contexts. However, what is still missing in the literature is a better understanding of the role of technology use for emergency messaging, particularly in local governments. Based on the Technology Affordances and Constraints Theory (TACT) and a practice perspective, we analyzed interview data from eighteen local emergency management agencies in the United States to investigate four questions: (1) what digital artifacts are used for writing and sending messages? (2) how do the artifacts afford emergency managers in writing and sending messages? (3) what are the constraints that impede effective messaging? and (4) how do governments cope with those difficulties? We find four types of artifacts involved in emergency messaging, their affordances, and constraints, as well as some strategies for mitigating negative impacts. The findings extend current knowledge about emergency messaging from the point of view of front-line staff and add insights into the TACT. • Using the Technology Affordances and Constraints Theory to understand information dissemination to the public. • Investigating emergency messaging from the message senders' perspective. • Identifying positive and negative impacts of technology on emergency messaging practices. • Highlighting emergency managers' capacity to tackle certain negative impacts.",20240301,"Chen, Tzuhao ; Gil-Garcia, J.

However, current research mainly centers on live streaming in commerce and entertainment, overlooking its affordances for episodic learning. Drawing from classic vicarious learning (VL) paradigms, and considering the perspectives of social media affordances and parasocial interaction, we propose a theoretical model for examining VL in live streaming and address research gaps. The proposed theoretical model was tested and validated through a three-wave data collection survey (t 1 , N = 504; t 2 , N = 438; t 3 , N = 256) from four popular Chinese live-streaming platforms. The results reveal two main forms of VL (i.e., independent and coactive), which users engage in to enhance their knowledge adoption in live streaming. Parasocial interaction, on one hand, directly affects knowledge adoption in live streaming, while VL plays a partial mediating role in the effect. Moreover, both VL and parasocial interaction benefit from social media affordances (i.e., browsing others' content, communication, metavoicing, and relationship formation). More important, although knowledge consensus can strengthen the impact of VL on knowledge adoption, it negatively moderates the influence of parasocial interaction on knowledge adoption.

"Library, Information Science & Technology Abstracts",lxh,188667333,Empowering green disposal behavior: the influence of gamification affordances and the multi-goal frame.,"Green disposal behavior (GDB) is the final, crucial behavioural outcome in the three stages of environmentally responsible consumption, which comprise the acquisition, use, and disposal of goods or services. With the increasing adoption of gamification in e-commerce platforms, many game-based green disposal activities have attracted millions of online users’ engagement and thus affected their cognition, motivation, and GDB. Previous studies have identified that motivation contributes to environmentally responsible consumption. However, the exploration of the inner psychological mechanism of multi-goal motives in gamification has been limited. Based on the ‘affordances–psychological outcomes–behavioral outcomes’ framework, we examine the relationships between gamification affordances, the multi-goal frame, and GDBs. The survey analysis of 420 users of a gamified disposal e-platform reveals that gamification affordances (i.e. autonomy support and interactivity) may energise GDB through the chain mediating intrinsic motivation of the multi-goal frame. The findings expand existing understandings of the inner psychological motivation and behaviour in the gamified context and call for design attention to influential gamification affordances that stimulate end-users’ attention and engagement.",20251001,"Du, Helen S. ; Yin, Jingtao ; Lin, Yixun ; Yang, Yihan",Article,Academic Journal,Oct2025,true,Behaviour & Information Technology,,JOUR,,,0144-929X,,,,,eng,Taylor & Francis Ltd,4169,4153,17,44,16,10.1080/0144929X.2025.2457012,,B6Q,,https://research.ebsco.com/linkprocessor/plink?id=065d6b7d-37be-3dd8-a9e9-2dade73224d8
"Library, Information Science & Technology Abstracts",lxh,119249036,Conceptualizing task affordance in online crowdsourcing context.,"Purpose The purpose of this paper is to present a new concept – task affordance in crowdsourcing context, and build it as a theoretical lens to help the authors reconfigure the artifacts and process in task-oriented crowdsourcing projects. The paper differs from previous studies by focusing on the relationships between the task artifacts, systems and goal-directed actors in crowdsourcing process rather than on the pure examination of task properties.Design/methodology/approach An operational definition of task affordance was proposed and a pseudo-entity-relationship model based approach was employed to portrait the task affordance in online crowdsourcing context. Furthermore, the authors developed a typology of task affordance and decomposed the concept into five dimensions, namely, design affordance, presentation affordance, assignment affordance, task-platform fit affordance, and task-worker fit affordance. A preliminary analysis of task affordances across various crowdsourcing categories was also conducted to validate the proposed typological framework.Findings The findings show that the task affordances have varying degree and extend among the diverse crowdsourcing categories. For instance, task design affordances seem to be low in the crowd processing and crowd rating cases compared with that in the crowd solving and crowd creation cases. For another example, in terms of the task presentation affordance, crowd rating cases need the lowest affordance while the crowd creation cases need the highest affordance. Therefore, the authors would like to emphasize that the successful adoption, implementation, and design of the task-oriented crowdsourcing owes to the careful examination of the relationships among the actors, artifacts, and environment of the crowdsourcing projects.Originality/value To the authors’ best knowledge, this paper is the first study on conceptualizing the task affordance in online crowdsourcing context. The study contributes to the academic literature on a comprehensive overview of task-related studies in crowdsourcing, which are scattered in several information related fields. Furthermore, this research contributes directly to the area of information science and technology due to a common interest in studying the environments and contexts in which people, information and technology interact and interplay. Practically, this study may yield some implications for the requester and platform operator when designing the relevant tasks or developing the specific crowdsourcing platform.",20161101,"Zhao, Yuxiang (Chris) ; Zhu, Qinghua",Article,Academic Journal,2016,true,Online Information Review,Crowdsourcing ; Entity-relationship modeling ; Information technology ; Information science ; Task analysis,JOUR,,,1468-4527,,,,,eng,Emerald Publishing Limited,958,938,21,40,7,10.1108/OIR-06-2015-0192,,9NA,,https://research.ebsco.com/linkprocessor/plink?id=77074656-c6ee-374f-92e0-8dccb4294a28
"Library, Information Science & Technology Abstracts",lxh,123258655,Affordance potency: Explaining the actualization of technology affordances.,"Given the importance of information technology (IT) in effecting organizational change, scholars have strived for many years to theorize the ways in which IT can produce the changes intended for it. Recent arguments claim that most information systems (IS) research has taken a limited theoretical focus on the information technology (IT) artifact, which arguably should be at the core of the IS discipline ( Benbasat & Zmud, 2003 ). This research engages directly with the IT artifact by evaluating the use of an electronic medical records system and its relation to actualization of technology affordances. We conducted a case study at a large urban acute care hospital in the Midwestern United States with registered nurses working on inpatient care units as the clinicians of interest. Through interviews with nurses and other clinical stakeholders, observation of nurse's work practices on three patient care units in the hospital, and direct examination of the medical records system, we develop theoretical insights into the role of IT in work practices. The novel concept of affordance potency is introduced as an integral theoretical construct in our model of affordances, helping to explain actualizations of IT in use.

"Library, Information Science & Technology Abstracts",lxh,125679438,Three key affordances for serendipity.,"Purpose Serendipity is an interesting phenomenon to study in information science as it plays a fundamental – but perhaps underestimated – role in how we discover, explore, and learn in all fields of life. The purpose of this paper is to operationalize the concept of serendipity by providing terminological “building blocks” for understanding connections between environmental and personal factors in serendipitous encounters. Understanding these connections is essential when designing affordances in physical and digital environments that can facilitate serendipity.Design/methodology/approach In this paper, serendipity is defined as what happens when we, in unplanned ways, encounter resources (information, things, people, etc.) that we find interesting. In the outlined framework, serendipity is understood as an affordance, i.e., a usage potential when environmental and personal factors correspond with each other. The framework introduces three key affordances for facilitating serendipity: diversifiability, traversability, and sensoriability, covering capacities of physical and digital environments to be diversified, traversed, and sensed. The framework is structured around couplings between the three key affordances and three key personal serendipity factors: curiosity, mobility, and sensitivity. Ten sub-affordances for serendipity and ten coupled personal sub-factors are also briefly outlined. Related research is compared with and mapped into the framework aiming at a theoretical validation. The affordance approach to serendipity is discussed, including different degrees and types of serendipity.Findings All the terminological “building blocks” in the framework are seen to resonate with the included related research. Serendipity is found to be a commonplace phenomenon in everyday life. It is argued that we cannot “engineer” nor “design” serendipity per se, but can design affordances for serendipity. Serendipity may thus be intended by designers, but must always be unplanned by users. The outlined affordance approach to serendipity points to the importance of our sensory-motor abilities to discover and explore serendipitous affordances.Research limitations/implications Implications of the framework for designing physical and digital environments with affordances for serendipity are briefly considered. It is suggested that physical environments may have a primacy regarding affordances of sensoriability for facilitating serendipity, and digital environments a primacy regarding traversability, whereas physical and digital environments may afford similar degrees of diversifiability. In future research, the framework needs further empirical validation in physical and digital environments.Originality/value No other research has been found addressing affordances for serendipity and connections between environmental and personal factors in similarly detailed ways.

Background Based on former affordance-related publications (primarily concerned with communication, community-building, collaboration, and social knowledge sharing), the common and differing narratives in relation to PKM are investigated in order to suggest further PKM capabilities and affordances in need to be conferred. Methodology The paper follows up on a series of the author's PKM-related publications, firmly rooted in design science research (DSR) methods and aimed at creating an innovative PKM concept and prototype system.

"Library, Information Science & Technology Abstracts",lxh,169872892,How commitment and platform adoption drive the e-commerce performance of SMEs: A mixed-method inquiry into e-commerce affordances.,"To cope with the digital transition exacerbated by the COVID-19 pandemic, managers of manufacturing small and medium enterprises (SMEs) need to adopt innovative practices to face uncertain scenarios and create long-term value, identified as transformational entrepreneurship practices. Among emerging digital technologies, digital platforms are shaping and outgrowing the e-commerce channel representing a potential opportunity for manufacturing SMEs to embrace digital transformation. Drawing on affordance theory, this research uses a mixed method approach to investigate how manufacturing SMEs' e-commerce commitment and digital platform adoption stimulate the actualization of three e-commerce affordances: consumer knowledge generation, internationalization, and customer diversification. Based on survey responses from 165 manufacturing SME managers, we find that direct selling through owned websites actualizes consumer knowledge generation and internationalization, indirect selling actualizes customer diversification and internationalization, and agency selling through third-party platforms actualizes all three affordances. The relationship between e-commerce commitment and ecommerce performance is mediated by consumer knowledge generation and internationalization but not by customer diversification. A fsQCA analysis outlines seven configurations actualizing these e-commerce affordances by pairing different ecommerce approaches with degrees of e-commerce commitment. Finally, an analysis of open-ended questions from 24 respondents complements the study and deeply interprets the seven unique configurations outlined. • Internationalization mediates the e-commerce commitment-performance relationship. • Consumer knowledge mediates the e-commerce commitment-performance relationship. • Diversification does not mediate the e-commerce commitment-performance relationship. • Seven configurations of commitment and platform adoption actualize the affordances.",20231001,"Ballerini, Jacopo ; Herhausen, Dennis ; Ferraris, Alberto",Article,Academic Journal,Oct2023,true,International Journal of Information Management,Digital technology ; Digital transformation ; Small business ; Electronic commerce ; Direct selling ; Consumer expertise,JOUR,,,0268-4012,,,,,eng,Elsevier B.V.,N.PAG,N.PAG,,72,,10.1016/j.ijinfomgt.2023.102649,,1LL,,https://research.ebsco.com/linkprocessor/plink?id=8dd64474-b9f8-3d70-8f21-f9c286c70bd0
"Library, Information Science & Technology Abstracts",lxh,116109143,Social media policies as responses for social media affordances: The case of China.,"The study aims to reveal how government organizations manage governmental social media use by employing policies to respond to the affordances of social media. The existing literature has mainly emphasized social media diffusion, use and their roles in social management. Little explores how government departments manage governmental social media use. The study tries to accomplish the goal by content analyzing seventy-six social media policy documents from Chinese government departments. The results found that Chinese government departments showed distinct strategies toward four affordances of social media. Government departments presented positive perceptions toward editability, but perceived more negative aspects of persistence. Meanwhile, government departments perceived both opportunities and challenges for visibility and interactivity. Moreover, Chinese government departments placed distinct emphasis on policy elements employed to govern the affordances. Overall, Chinese government departments highlighted policy elements such as employee response, account presentation, content vetting, human resources and scopes of content, but paid little attention to policy elements like content accessibility, account termination, rules for citizen commenting, and financial resources.",20160401,"Chen, Qiang ; Xu, Xiaolin ; Cao, Bolin ; Zhang, Wei",Article,Academic Journal,Apr2016,true,Government Information Quarterly,Social media ; Internet in public administration ; Government websites ; China ; Government policy ; Public administration ; Government business enterprises ; Government publicity,JOUR,,,0740-624X,,,,,eng,Elsevier B.V.,324,313,12,33,2,10.1016/j.giq.2016.04.008,,GIQ,,https://research.ebsco.com/linkprocessor/plink?id=d047c612-6c59-370a-af80-6507f77b4440

A primarily audio-based language learning application – ‘Vowel Trainer’, was chosen against a comparison, text and picture-based language learning application – ‘Learn English for Taxi Drivers’. Impressions of the two applications were assessed on two different devices that have virtually the same interface and identical sound output (when headphones are used), but differ in physical size: the iPhone and the iPad. A mixed design was chosen, with native language as a group factor and device type (iPad vs. iPhone) and language application type (audio vs. video) as within groups factors. Assessments of sensory and cognitive affordances were made, along with measurement of learner preferences of each application. Data from 41 participants (21 native English speakers, 20 non-native English speakers) were analysed, revealing device differences in both audio and visual subjective quality ratings, despite only visual quality being affected by the device's physical limitations. We suggest that sensory affordances (indexed by subjective quality) are not simply a function of physical limitations, but are heavily influenced by context. The implications for developing design guidelines for language learning and other multimedia applications are discussed.",20160401,"Uther, Maria ; Banks, Adrian P",Article,Academic Journal,Apr2016,true,Behaviour & Information Technology,Mobile apps ; Multimedia systems ; Pocket computers ; Questionnaires ; User interfaces ; Data analysis ; United Kingdom ; College students ; Analysis of variance ; Auditory perception ; Language & languages ; Learning strategies ; Statistics ; Visual perception ; Task performance ; Smartphones,JOUR,,,0144-929X,,,,,eng,Taylor & Francis Ltd,289,277,13,35,4,10.1080/0144929X.2016.1151077,,B6Q,,https://research.ebsco.com/linkprocessor/plink?id=b1a16cbc-7bed-3a2c-884c-1426105e89b9

However, how project practices are mediated by constant connectivity is under-explored and under-theorized. We conduct a case study of the interplay between consulting project work practices and constant connectivity to address this gap. Our findings point to three potential insights. First, we highlight that consulting projects in the focal context are characterized by clockwork coordination logic. Second, we show there is affinity between front-stage practices and synchronous smartphone affordances on the one hand as well as between backstage practices and asynchronous smartphone affordances on the other. Third, we describe how clockwork coordination and connectivity affordances give rise to decoupling of legacy timespace from backstage practices while reinforcing the legacy timespace of the front-stage practices.

Following a user‐centered approach firmly grounded in information science, this study is dedicated to optimizing interaction patterns with algorithmic affordances, aiming to augment the diversity of the content consumed and induce favorable attitude changes. A controlled experiment was conducted on a mock personalized recommender system that provided both information and interactivity affordances, exemplified by stance labels and stance‐based filters, respectively. A total of 142 participants were recruited to browse recommendations generated by the system on a specific controversial topic, and the selectivity of their information consumption behavior and the change in their attitude extremity were measured. It was found that both types of affordances were effective in reducing users' behavioral selectivity. While stance labels inhibited the consumption of pro‐attitudinal information, stance‐based filters facilitated the consumption of counter‐attitudinal information. Furthermore, the affordances could immediately mitigate the attitude extremity of those with a higher level of algorithmic literacy.

"Library, Information Science & Technology Abstracts",lxh,88176413,Conceptualizing perceived affordances in social media interaction design.,"Purpose – The purpose of this paper is to theoretically develop the concept of perceived affordance based on the existing studies, and to construct a conceptual framework to show how perceived affordances can facilitate the interaction design of social media. Design/methodology/approach – The paper provides a review of the relevant literature on affordance and perceived affordance, and conceptually proposes a typology of perceived affordances in social media and an integrative framework for interaction design from sociomateriality perspective. Furthermore, a brief empirical example on the interaction design of crowdsourcing systems is used to ground and illustrate the authors' conceptual framework. Findings – The paper shows that the perceived affordances may have multi-facet characteristics and the interaction design of social media should reflect the multi-dimensional perceived affordances. The perceived affordances can support or facilitate the design of basic elements of social media, such as content and form, to enhance both usability (human-computer interaction) and sociability (human-human interaction). A position of constitutive entanglement does not privilege either users or social media artifacts, nor does it provide a rigid triangle among these three components. Instead, the perceived affordances play a critical role in integrating the key components in social media interaction design as an ensemble. Originality/value – The paper attempts to explore and develop the concept of perceived affordance and employ it as a theoretical lens to underpin interaction design of social media.

"Library, Information Science & Technology Abstracts",lxh,161814545,A conceptual model of feedback mechanisms in adjusted affordances – Insights from usage of a mental mobile health application.,"Affordance theory provides one of the most prominent lenses through which the socio-technical aspects of a system's use can be investigated and understood. In this context, the literature has proposed that perceived and actualized affordances may be adjusted over time. Yet, how the adjustment of affordances occurs has not been explained in detail. Thus, in this article, we develop a conceptual model of feedback mechanisms that includes a more explicit description of how affordances are perceived by users, whether actualized and adjusted. With the model, we introduce the central concept of a generative base , out of which affordance perceptions emerge and which can be updated through affordance actualizations. With this base, we integrate mental model (MM) theory to explain better the differing perceptions before and after actor–artifact interactions. Our conceptual model is illustrated and specified using an empirical case of the mental mobile health (mHealth) app ""Between The Lines"" in Germany. In this study, we conducted 40 interviews in two rounds with 20 teenage app users. Our results show that the users' perceptions of mHealth affordances become adjusted and hence change over time due to experiencing the actualization process, which may lead to an update of the generative base, including the user's MM. • Affordance Theory is one of the most prominent lenses to investigate IT use. • We clarify how the perception of technological affordances is adjusted over time. • A conceptual model of feedback mechanisms in adjusted affordances is introduced. • The conceptual model is illustrated by insights from usage of a mental mHealth app. • Results highlight the role of updated mental models for adjusted affordance perception.",20230401,"Meske, Christian ; Amojo, Ireti ; Thapa, Devinder",Article,Academic Journal,Apr2023,true,International Journal of Information Management,Mobile apps ; Germany ; Mobile health ; Conceptual models ; Mental health ; Sociotechnical systems ; Teenage pregnancy ; Psychological feedback,JOUR,,,0268-4012,,,,,eng,Elsevier B.V.,N.PAG,N.PAG,,69,,10.1016/j.ijinfomgt.2022.102597,,1LL,,https://research.ebsco.com/linkprocessor/plink?id=98fb0653-cad5-3109-99cd-a4416b09c31c
"Library, Information Science & Technology Abstracts",lxh,124676349,A study of emergent organizing and technological affordances after a natural disaster.,"Purpose: Drawing on the model of technology-in-practice and the literature on bona fide approaches and technological affordances, the purpose of this paper is to argue that collectives involved in emergency response may exhibit similar and different usage patterns for technology due to the combined influence of the temporal development of the response actions and the existing and newly enacted organizational, social, and technological structures. Design/methodology/approach: To enrich the argument about the inter-related influence on response organizations' use of technology across phases of the disaster response, this research uses a multi-method and longitudinal case study of citizen-based response organizations after Hurricane Sandy. Findings: Findings show that technologies were used similarly by response organizations immediately after the hurricane, whereas the later use of technologies exhibited variations. Moreover, Twitter was used consistently for diverse purposes across the phases of the disaster response, whereas Facebook usage among organizations first diverged and then converged two months after the hurricane. The organizations' different patterns of social media use also reflected the construction and reconstruction of resource networks for relief operations over time. Research limitations/implications: This study integrates multiple theoretical frameworks in explaining the processes and outcomes of technology use for collectives in emergency response, which presents an example of bridging and enriching the theoretical constructs from the areas of technology adaptation and emergency management. Practical implications: Findings of this study provide practical knowledge about the mechanisms of integrating multiple information systems into the building of resilient social systems for emergency response. Social implications: Findings of this study enrich social understanding about how the use of technologies for collective activity in emergency situations can go beyond one-time events and lay the foundation for long-term resilient emergency management.

"Library, Information Science & Technology Abstracts",lxh,99333553,Affordances for practice.,"This paper argues that Gibson's concept of affordance inserts a powerful conceptual lens for the study of sociomateriality as enacted in contemporary organizational practices. Our objective in this paper is to develop a comprehensive view of affordances that builds upon the existing conceptualizations in the psychology, human–computer interaction, sociology and information systems literatures and extend them in three important ways. First, we show that taking an integrative interpretation of affordance as dispositional and relational, rather than the standard unidimensional interpretation, provides a theoretical articulation of how the material and the social influence each other. Second, we propose to broaden the focus from the affordances of technology to the affordances for practice provided jointly by technology and organizing. This means considering social affordances alongside technological affordances. Finally, we argue that the best way to integrate the study of social and technological affordances is not to stretch Gibson's original concept to include the social but rather to complement it with a sociological concept that fits it neatly: Bourdieu's idea of habitus. Our claim is that the concepts of affordance and habitus complement and complete each other. Affordance offers a useful way of thinking about how practice is patterned by the social and physical construction of technology and the material environment and habitus offers a useful way of thinking about how practice is patterned by social and symbolic structures. We describe how affordances and habitus may be used together to provide a theoretical apparatus to study practice as a sociomaterial entanglement, thus adding to the methodological toolkit of scholars embracing a sociomaterial perspectives.",20141001,"Fayard, Anne-Laure ; Weeks, John",Article,Academic Journal,Oct2014,true,Information & Organization,Human-computer interaction ; Information storage & retrieval systems ; Sociomateriality ; Psychology ; Sociology ; Social influence,JOUR,,,1471-7727,,,,,eng,Elsevier B.V.,249,236,14,24,4,10.1016/j.infoandorg.2014.10.001,,JG1,,https://research.ebsco.com/linkprocessor/plink?id=fb9d7ae1-d073-3257-b553-94547e3a43d7
"Library, Information Science & Technology Abstracts",lxh,94509848,(Hyper) local news aggregation: Designing for social affordances.,"Being able to debate, reflect, form opinions, consider counter evidence and make informed decisions is a foundation of civic life in democratic societies. Government benefits from broad participation in collective decision making in terms of sustainable outcomes (e.g., greater consensus) and quality of life in our cities and communities. These collective decision making capabilities are undermined by a strange combination of diminishing (or extinct) local print media, especially local newspapers, and by its obverse, a plethora of information and communication opportunities that are scattered across numerous disparate and decentralized websites and resources (e.g., webpages, RSS feeds, social network software, email, listservs, podcasts, tweets). To address this problem, a number of news aggregators have emerged that capture local content from dispersed sites. To facilitate civic engagement, these sites also need to support social interaction and information exchange. In this paper we review the state of the art in local news aggregation in the U.S. and their support for social affordances (social trust, networks and interaction) that are essential to civic participation. We present a system we call the Virtual Town Square (VTS) that we have developed for local news aggregation that supports social affordances. We summarize briefly the design strategies and techniques (e.g., algorithms) we used to cluster topics and user generated content derived from existing local sources.

"Library, Information Science & Technology Abstracts",lxh,78290586,Exploring the affordance and acceptance of an e-reader device as a collaborative learning system.,"Purpose – The aim of this research is to identify users' perceived affordances and explore how they influence the acceptance of an e-reader device collaborative learning system. Design/methodology/approach – The paper reports on two studies conducted to identify and explore perceived affordances. The first study enabled four users to experience a collaborative problem-solving task to elicit perceived affordances. The second study developed and used a survey instrument based on a modified technology acceptance model with 54 participants to investigate the influences of the affordances on users' acceptance using the partial least square technique. Findings – Five major affordance factors were found to be significantly influencing users' acceptance of the proposed system. These affordance factors are: mobility affordance, support affordance, connectivity affordance, immediacy affordance, and collaborative affordance. Surprisingly, sustainability affordance was found to have limited influence on the acceptance of the proposed system. Research limitations/implications – The findings can be applied to other e-reader devices with features similar to iLiad such as Sony PRS, Kobo, Nook, PocketBook and Viewsonic. Prototyping is a critical design process which aims to elicit user experiences. The research implies that the prototype system is capable of generating perceived affordances that are useful for e-reader device development in order to enhance acceptance. The convenience sample used in the survey is biased towards male participants. As male and female users perceive information and communications technologies (ICT) differently, caution should be taken when applying the findings to the general population. Practical implications – Practitioners should focus on utilising the support affordance of the system and identifying clear learning goals with the help of collaborative affordance as the learning pedagogy. System designers should focus on creating a good range of visible support affordances that are intuitive, while enhancing or complementing the collaborative learning affordances. The design of an integrated chat application is important as it lays the foundation for ensuring that collaborative learning with e-reader devices is possible. Originality/value – E-reader devices have not been studied extensively as collaborative learning systems. This research is believed to be the first to integrate and explore the use of an e-reader device in a collaborative learning environment.

"Library, Information Science & Technology Abstracts",lxh,51484561,Affordance-based categorization of road network data using a grounded theory of channel networks.,"We propose a grounded ontological theory of channel networks to categorize features, such as junctions, in road network databases. The theory is grounded, because its primitives can be given an unambiguous interpretation into directly observable qualities of physical road networks, such as supported movements and their medium, connectedness of such media, and turnoff restrictions. The theory provides a very general approach to automatically annotate and integrate road network data from heterogeneous sources, because it rests on application-independent observation principles. We suggest that road network categories such as junctions and roads are based on locomotion affordances. Road network databases can be mapped into our channel network theory, so that instances of roads and junctions can be automatically categorized or checked for consistency by what they afford. In this paper, we introduce affordance-based definitions of a road network and a junction, and show that the definition of latter is satisfied by some of the most common junction types.",20100801,"Scheider, Simon ; Kuhn, Werner",Article,Academic Journal,Aug2010,true,International Journal of Geographical Information Science,Databases ; Roads ; Locomotion ; Grounded theory ; Transportation,JOUR,,,1365-8816,,,,,eng,Taylor & Francis Ltd,1267,1249,19,24,8,10.1080/13658810903514198,,B7P,,https://research.ebsco.com/linkprocessor/plink?id=e9e614e5-0e59-3952-a0bd-c60e2652cf00

Using data from an Internet questionnaire (N = 635) on the use of the short message service (SMS) for mobile phone text messaging ('texting'), we examine two components of an affordance pathways hypothesis of SMS uptake: (1) mobile phone users must first discover and make use of hidden social affordances of texting in order to obtain significant interpersonal benefit from the medium, and (2) key social and psychological variables differentially predispose users to capitalise on these affordances. We developed and validated latent factor measures of texting affordances and relationship outcomes, examined the differential effects of a range of predictor variables on these measures, and tested a model in which the expressive and conversational use of texting mediates the effects of social anxiety, loneliness, age, and relationship status on relationship outcomes. This model proved a significant fit to the data, and was superior to alternative models which systematically varied the causal priority of SMS affordances and relationship outcomes.

"Library, Information Science & Technology Abstracts",lxh,160693306,Stressing affordances: Towards an appraisal theory of technostress through a case study of hospital nurses' use of electronic medical record systems.,"Nurses use electronic medical record (EMR) systems to accomplish a variety of care-related tasks. Nurses, therefore, encounter a range of stressful situations and events related to using EMR systems, a phenomenon known as technostress. Previous research suggests that individuals appraise technostress differently. However, not much is known about the appraisal process of technostress. By integrating the literature on technostress, affordances, and appraisal theory, this paper introduces the appraisal theory of technostress, which is developed empirically through an interpretive case study involving interviews with hospital nurses. The appraisal theory of technostress explains how individuals process and appraise information about how to potentially act on technology-related stressful events through a system's features. Information about the event, and information about the action potential afforded by the system's features, is evaluated through an appraisal process that includes three appraisal checks: goal relevance, goal conduciveness, and value compatibility. The appraisal checks verify whether the action possibilities of the system's features align or misalign with an individual's goals and values related to action, and shape how the event and the system's features are appraised as challenge or hindrance techno-stressors. Overall, the study offers a novel theoretical perspective and methodological approach to conceptualizing and investigating technostress. More detailed contributions to research and practice are also discussed. • Offers a new conceptualization of the appraisal process of technostress. • Uses affordances to theorize what happens in the appraisal process. • Defines the role affordances play in technostress through goals and values. • Identifies key mechanisms in the appraisal process of technostress. • Builds a conceptual model of technostress and affordances through an interpretive case study in the context of healthcare IT.",20221201,"Califf, Christopher B.",Article,Academic Journal,Dec2022,true,Information & Organization,Electronic health records ; Hospital personnel ; Action potentials ; Life change events ; Conceptual models,JOUR,,,1471-7727,,,,,eng,Elsevier B.V.,N.PAG,N.PAG,,32,4,10.1016/j.infoandorg.2022.100431,,JG1,,https://research.ebsco.com/linkprocessor/plink?id=b82bb2eb-5237-3889-b5a2-4bdebd503e90
"Library, Information Science & Technology Abstracts",lxh,113424172,Examining Graphing Calculator Affordances in Learning Pre-Calculus among Undergraduate Students.,"This study examines graphing calculator affordances in learning mathematics among college precalculus students. The study draws from the Cognitive Load Theory (CLT) and the ""Intelligent Technology"" theoretical framework proposed by Salomon, Perkins, and Globerson (1991). From these perspectives the effects ""with"" the graphing calculator technology include the potential for this technology to offload students' extraneous cognitive load (e.g., the presence of unwieldy numbers), and in turn optimize their germane cognitive load (e.g., freeing students to focus on the key mathematical ideas).

"Library, Information Science & Technology Abstracts",lxh,158957967,Developing effective e-learning environments through e-learning use mediating technology affordance and constructivist learning aspects for performance impacts: Moderator of learner involvement.,"E-learning use indicates the success of implementing e-learning environments since it plays a key role in mediating drivers for goal achievement. The motivation for e-learning use greatly depends on developing effective e-learning processes. Two particular issues, technology use and constructivist learning, are proposed for further defining three key determinants, technology affordances, e-content interaction, and e-social interaction, as the determinants of e-learning use, and in turn, academic performance. The three determinants for their integration are unique for a special guide to effective e-learning design. Learner involvement is an emotional moderator for an interactive role with e-learning use. An existing e-learning environment with learning experience is used to collect both subjective and objective data. Technology affordances and e-content interaction have important influence on e-learning use, whereas e-social interaction does not. E-learning use also indicates the importance as a key mediator to achieve academic performance. Learner involvement shows insignificance with the moderating role. These findings have important implications for developing new learning approaches and effective e-learning processes, in particular, the insignificance of e-social interaction and learner involvement. • E-learning use is an important performance indicator for e-learning. • Constructivist learning and technology affordance aspects explain e-learning use. • Constructivist e-learning defines e-content and e-social interactions. • E-content interaction is the strongest factor on e-learning use. • E-learning use has a positive effect on academic performance.",20221001,"Wu, Ing-Long ; Hsieh, Pi-Jung ; Wu, Shwu-Ming",Article,Academic Journal,Oct2022,true,Internet & Higher Education,Educational technology ; Constructivism (Education) ; Digital learning ; Academic achievement ; Classroom environment,JOUR,,,1096-7516,,,,,eng,Elsevier B.V.,N.PAG,N.PAG,,55,,10.1016/j.iheduc.2022.100871,,5CO,,https://research.ebsco.com/linkprocessor/plink?id=b3b4860c-191a-320e-ba5b-8811a68d39a3

Elaborating on the data of a previous experimental study with 453 adolescents, we compared bystanders’ behavioural intentions to help the victim according to their ‘mediacy’ (via communication technologies (CT) or face-to-face) and their ‘privacy’ (in public or in private). Furthermore, we investigated whether the context of the harassing incident (incident severity, identity and behaviour of other bystanders) influenced the ‘mediacy’ and ‘privacy’ of bystanders’ helping intentions. The results showed that in general bystanders had higher behavioural intentions to help the victim in private (vs. in public) and via CT (vs. face-to-face). While incident severity influenced the ‘mediacy’ of bystanders’ helping intentions, the identity and behaviour of other bystanders affected the ‘privacy’ of their helping intentions.",20150401,"Bastiaensens, Sara ; Vandebosch, Heidi ; Poels, Karolien ; Van Cleemput, Katrien ; DeSmet, Ann ; De Bourdeaudhuij, Ilse",Article,Academic Journal,Apr2015,true,Behaviour & Information Technology,Communication ; Experimental design ; Privacy ; Social media ; Belgium ; High school students ; Analysis of variance ; Bullying ; Chi-squared test ; Confidence intervals ; Intention ; Medical ethics ; Research funding ; Social skills ; Repeated measures design ; Data analysis software,JOUR,,,0144-929X,,,,,eng,Taylor & Francis Ltd,435,425,11,34,4,10.1080/0144929X.2014.983979,,B6Q,,https://research.ebsco.com/linkprocessor/plink?id=8f749456-cd3d-33c8-b529-7e993174237a

The death of a child is an uncomfortable subject in most contemporary societies. This limits the exploration of experiences and possibilities for coping with grief. However, with the introduction of social media, this has changed. Theoretical perspectives on parental grief recognizing the importance of continued relational bonds with the lost child are used, together with the ontological assumption that social media enhance the dissolving of private/public and time/space. This study is based on questionnaire, interviews, and content from the closed peer grief support community, to which the research team has insider access. The community encompasses a diverse range of experiences and stages of grief, independent of the time elapsed since the loss of a child. Bereavement of children of all ages and from all conceivable causes of death is distributed among the members. The results show how the affordances of social media become vital resources for coping with grief in ways not available previously, comprising aspects of the closed nature of the group, shared experiences, time, and accessibility.",20150301,"Hård Af Segerstad, Ylva ; Kasperowski, Dick",Article,Academic Journal,Mar-Jun2015,true,New Review of Hypermedia & Multimedia,Social media ; Parental grief ; Social support ; Internet & psychology ; Internet & society ; Psychology,JOUR,,,1361-4568,,,,,eng,Taylor & Francis Ltd,41,25,17,21,1/2,10.1080/13614568.2014.983557,,RQN,,https://research.ebsco.com/linkprocessor/plink?id=398d7271-cf11-31d0-9f3a-39246f10733c

With the increasing adoption of gamification in the online environment, consumers are stimulated to perform such citizenship behaviours like recommendations, helping others and feedback. Drawing on the ""Affordances-Psychological Outcomes-Behavioural Outcomes"" framework and related literature, this study examines the relationships among perceived gamification affordances, psychological ownership and consumer citizenship behaviour. Based on the survey of 387 gamified MiniApps consumers in the e-commerce platforms, structural equation modelling is used to examine the model, and the results support most hypotheses. The research extends our understanding of the direct and indirect effects of perceived gamification affordances on consumer citizenship behaviour, and the mediating role of psychological ownership. • Perceived gamification affordances can generate psychological ownership. • Perceived gamification affordances can affect consumer citizenship behaviour. • Psychological ownership plays a mediating role in the above relationship. • Psychological ownership results in consumer citizenship behaviour.",20220601,"Xu, Jiahong ; Du, Helen S. ; Shen, Kathy Ning ; Zhang, Depeng",Article,Academic Journal,Jun2022,true,International Journal of Information Management,Virtual communities ; Consumer behavior ; Gamification ; Psychological ownership ; Structural equation modeling ; Influence ; Home ownership ; Modern society,JOUR,,,0268-4012,,,,,eng,Elsevier B.V.,N.PAG,N.PAG,,64,,10.1016/j.ijinfomgt.2022.102477,,1LL,,https://research.ebsco.com/linkprocessor/plink?id=e9728c69-9e1a-3fbd-8697-b48ddf70dec9

Findings: The research on VR in marketing has experienced significant growth over the past 10 years and is projected to continue thriving in the future. During the past decade, research in this field has transitioned from exploring VR affordances in marketing to realizing the potential of VR in marketing. From the information systems perspective, the three primary research trends that have garnered the most attention from researchers are VR technology as an artifact, marketers' motivational approach and consumers' motivational approach. With the continual advancement of VR technology, the research trend of Metaverse marketing will gradually displace VR in marketing.

"Library, Information Science & Technology Abstracts",lxh,185260614,Enterprise social networks and the work context: a case study of mandated use.,"Purpose: Enterprise social networks (ESN) that enable faster communications and knowledge sharing at work are an integral part of many workplaces. Although the affordances potency and actualization constructs identify work context as important, few studies to date have teased out how the interactions between ESN's affordances, users' goals and the work context drive affordances actualization. Design/methodology/approach: This research is a case study of a technology multinational that made the ESN Chatter mandatory for all internal communications. We conducted a thematic analysis of 40 h of non-participatory observation, 15 in-depth interviews and eight informal conversations with employees. Findings: There was considerable variation in how employees across different functional roles perceived affordances' potencies, leading to differences in the nature and intensity of actualization: while sales and project managers embraced Chatter, technical support participants mostly resisted it; visibility was the central affordance for sales and human resources, but persistence was more important for project managers and association for technical support and billing. An organizational culture of accountability, urgency and efficiency interacted with Chatter's affordances in a mutually reinforcing way, strengthening accountability and accelerating processes. Collaboration was enhanced but in a mostly coercive way. While sales participants' motivation was boosted, the mandated use of Chatter rendered tasks not inputted in Chatter invisible and created antagonism between departments. Practical implications: Practitioners should not underestimate the influence of different work contexts and employees' goals when implementing an ESN. Since employees are concerned with managing their workload and how others perceive them, they may resist ESNs that they perceive as creating additional work and they may attempt to manage impressions at the expense of the work climate. Organizations looking to implement an ESN as their main communication tool would greatly benefit from establishing training programs and clear guidelines on positive communication practices across functional roles such as sales and technical support, and between peers. Originality/value: Our study is one of the first to shed light on the role of the work context, i.e. functional role and organizational culture, in explaining the intensity and specificity of affordance actualization across an organization.",20250501,"Ollier-Malaterre, Ariane ; Redston, Marianne",Article,Academic Journal,2025,true,Information Technology & People,Work environment ; Organizational accountability ; Corporate culture ; Social enterprises ; Social networks,JOUR,,,0959-3845,,,,,eng,Emerald Publishing Limited,1990,1969,22,38,4,10.1108/ITP-05-2023-0411,,67S,,https://research.ebsco.com/linkprocessor/plink?id=d0783fb1-0b15-31f3-a2a2-9eca5feb1a0c

To facilitate this, personal data must be collected and processed, often without the users' explicit awareness. Many users view political online microtargeting as an intrusion upon their privacy. In a longitudinal time-based sampling study shortly before, during, and after the German Federal Election in 2021, we surveyed social media users (N = 126) about their perception of political online microtargeting and individual privacy. In particular, we evaluated participants' perception of being targeted, perceived social media affordances (anonymity, association), availability of privacy mechanisms (control, trust, norms, communication), and their subjective experience of privacy (experienced level of access, privacy perception). Furthermore, we evaluated how these variables influence users' privacy regulation behaviours (interdependent or egocentric), political self-efficacy, future political information behaviour, and voting behaviour in the light of political online microtargeting. Multilevel analyses revealed that it is difficult for users to detect targeted ads, but that they feel more private and self-efficacious in their political and future political information behaviour if they believe they can rely on privacy mechanisms such as trust and control.",20250801,"Börsting, Johanna ; Frener, Regine ; Trepte, Sabine",Article,Academic Journal,Aug2025,true,Behaviour & Information Technology,Right of privacy ; Social media ; Questionnaires ; Content analysis ; Longitudinal method ; Communication ; Information literacy ; Germany ; Medical ethics laws ; Self-efficacy ; Consumer attitudes ; Descriptive statistics ; Social norms ; Federal government ; Elections ; Social attitudes ; Voting ; Trust ; Social marketing ; Comparative studies ; Data analysis software ; Political participation ; Regression analysis,JOUR,,,0144-929X,,,,,eng,Taylor & Francis Ltd,3114,3097,18,44,12,10.1080/0144929X.2024.2431052,,B6Q,,https://research.ebsco.com/linkprocessor/plink?id=6f7b8543-aecd-3f61-903f-8834974a88af

This paper uses the affordances framework to investigate how Generation Z (GenZ) students in higher education use generative AI (GenAI). There is an increasing need to gain a deeper understanding of GenZ's interaction with artificial intelligence tools to better support their integration into higher education and the workforce. Method. Data was collated from semi-structured interviews with 34 GenZ students in higher education. Analysis. Thematic analysis was conducted on the qualitative data collected from the semi-structured interviews. Results. The findings suggest GenZ students have seamlessly integrated GenAI into diverse aspects of their lives. This study highlighted three main GenAI affordances that resonate with GenZ students: a) content searching and curation b) content generation and ideation, and c) content enhancement and refinement, revealing new opportunities for information access. Conclusions. This study shed light on the perceived affordances of GenAI for GenZs, addressing a gap in the current literature on GenAI. The findings underscore the significant extent to which GenAI has been integrated into GenZ students' daily lives. Our study contributes to a better understanding of how GenAI's affordances facilitate and support GenZ students, providing invaluable insights that can inform future policies on developing literacy for AI use tailored to this group.",20250102,"Lee, Chei Sian ; Tan, Li En ; Goh, Dion Hoe-Lian",Article,Academic Journal,2025 Special issue,true,Information Research,Acquisition of data ; Content analysis ; Generative artificial intelligence ; Higher education ; User-generated content,JOUR,,,1368-1613,,,,,eng,University of Boras,1102,1095,8,30,,10.47989/ir30iConf47083,,EB6,,https://research.ebsco.com/linkprocessor/plink?id=d611513a-311c-32c2-bf85-3966dd2d1eab

Depression is a major contributor to disability and will be a leading cause of global disease burden by 2030. There is a high depression rate in Saudi Arabia. Online Mental health communities (OMHCs) are important for people with mental health conditions who are concerned about the stigma associated with these conditions. Paralinguistic digital affordances (PDAs) are a useful social affordance enabled by social media. This study aimed to understand the role of using PDAs in Saudi OMHCs. Method. Qualitative methods were employed to analyse a sample of 1331 posts from two Saudi OMHCs. Analysis. Data were thematically analysed using Braun and Clarke's method. Results. PDAs fostered receiving emotional and informational support and were used to communicate frustrating emotions. A variety of emojis was used to provide encouragement to other users in response to their posts and conveyed different forms of support. PDAs were also used to show empathy and to acknowledge other people's feelings and to reassure them. However, on occasion, PDAs were used in a negative way. Conclusion. PDAs provide additional emotional and informational support to encourage people with depression in OMHCs. Future research could interview OMHC users to develop a deeper understanding of how PDAs provide support.",20250102,"Alrashed, Sara ; Bath, Peter A ; Koya, Kushwanth",Article,Academic Journal,2025 Special issue,true,Information Research,Virtual communities ; Saudi Arabia ; Paralinguistics ; Mental health services ; Empathy,JOUR,,,1368-1613,,,,,eng,University of Boras,959,941,19,30,,10.47989/ir30iConf47158,,EB6,,https://research.ebsco.com/linkprocessor/plink?id=636d273a-9b0a-3c28-be92-650f146f0dd9
"Library, Information Science & Technology Abstracts",lxh,186290804,"Giving voice to community: Embodied scholarship, generative discussion, and other affordances of scholarly podcasting.","Scholarly publishing often focuses on the end product—a journal article, a monograph—with little homage paid to those who, formally and informally, helped shape the artifact. As open movements gain momentum and support, and the peer review process faces scrutiny, there is an opportunity to reevaluate the purpose of scholarly publishing and its artifacts, the ways in which our current publishing models shape our perspective of knowledge production as a largely individual endeavor. Scholarly podcasting can be one way in which we re-envision what publishing looks—and sounds—like. This article explores the affordances of podcasting as a medium in terms of its utility to allow scholars to audibly embody their work and facilitate gathering and community, bringing their personhood and identities into the expression of their research, as well as the four genres of podcasting that take greatest advantage of these affordances. Open peer review podcasting, a facet of scholarly podcasting, can bring to the forefront the ways in which a community of scholars ultimately shapes a final product, refocusing the purpose of peer review on supportive critique that yields a more meaningful and robust final artifact rather than the box-ticking or gatekeeping purposes it sometimes serves in the current publishing landscape. It also makes visible—and audible—the very real network of individuals that makes a solo authored artifact possible. By undergoing open peer review via podcast, distilling the conversation, and making visible the changes made to the article based on that conversation, this article both explores the theoretical possibilities of scholarly podcasting while modeling the process.",20250101,"Sewell, Amber",Article,Academic Journal,2025,true,Journal of Electronic Publishing,Scholarly peer review ; Scholarly publishing ; Podcasting ; Periodical articles ; Gatekeeping,JOUR,,,1080-2711,,,,,eng,Michigan Publishing,26,1,26,28,1,10.3998/jep.6036,,DO6,,https://research.ebsco.com/linkprocessor/plink?id=a19a45e3-2342-303c-98ee-38981848c29b

"Library, Information Science & Technology Abstracts",lxh,152847458,"Not everything is as it seems: Digital technology affordance, pandemic control, and the mediating role of sociomaterial arrangements.","An overly favorable narrative has developed around the role played by digital technologies in containing Covid-19, which oversimplifies the complexity of technology adoption. This narrative takes sociomaterial arrangements for granted and conceptualizes technology affordance - the problem-solving capability of a technology - as a standard built-in feature that automatically activates during technology deployment, leading to undiversified and predetermined collective benefits. This paper demonstrates that not everything is as it seems; implementing a technology is a necessary but insufficient condition for triggering its potential problem-solving capability. The potential affordance and effects of a technology are mediated by the sociomaterial arrangements that users assemble to connect their goals to the materiality of technological artifacts and socio-organizational context in which technology deployment takes place. To substantiate this argument and illustrate the mediating role of sociomaterial arrangements, we build on sociomateriality and technology affordance theory, and we present the results of a systematic review of Covid-19 literature in which 2187 documents are examined. The review combines text data mining, co-occurrence pattern recognition, and inductive coding, and it focuses on four digital technologies that public authorities have deployed as virus containment measures: infrared temperature-sensing devices; ICT-based surveillance and contact-tracing systems; bioinformatic tools and applications for laboratory testing; and electronic mass communications media. Reporting on our findings, we add nuances to the academic debate on sociomateriality, technology affordance, and the governance of technology in public health crises. In addition, we provide public authorities with practical recommendations on how to strengthen their approach to digital technology deployment for pandemic control. • An overly favorable narrative has developed around the role played by digital technologies in containing Covid-19 • This narrative suggests potential affordances activate by default during technology adoption and always manifest in full • We expose the limitations of this oversimplistic view by examining government-led digital technology deployment • Technology affordance is a context-specific feature, which is mediated by existing sociomaterial arrangements • When identical technological solutions are used, different levels of affordance can materialize (potential vs actual)",20211001,"Mora, Luca ; Kummitha, Rama Krishna Reddy ; Esposito, Giovanni",Article,Academic Journal,Oct2021,true,Government Information Quarterly,Digital technology ; Telecommunication ; Pandemics ; Medical technology,JOUR,,,0740-624X,,,,,eng,Elsevier B.V.,N.PAG,N.PAG,,38,4,10.1016/j.giq.2021.101599,,GIQ,,https://research.ebsco.com/linkprocessor/plink?id=e6695094-eb1a-31fa-ac31-1d01182fd33e

This study systemically evaluated the current literature to understand the potential of ESMPs in influencing employees' impression management strategies from the affordance perspective. Drawing from a focused review of the literature on ESMPs' affordances and impression management, this paper reclassified employees' impression management strategies in the context of ESMPs. It proposes a conceptual framework that captures the complex relationship between ESMPs' affordances and employees' various impression management strategies. The framework highlights that ESMPs' affordances affect employees' impression management strategies, both positively and negatively, and proposes the contingent effects of individual motives and boundary management on the relationship between affordances and employees' impression management strategies.

We illustrate our insights by focusing on the practices of information seeking in everyday life, suggesting that the affordances of AI systems integrated into search engines, social media platforms, streaming services, and media generation, shape such practices in ways that may, paradoxically, result both in the increase and reduction of diversity of and access to information. We discuss the potential implications of these developments in terms of the sustainability of information ecosystems and suggest solutions for addressing them through regulation and education.

"Library, Information Science & Technology Abstracts",lxh,181055532,Leveraging digital methods in the quest for peaceful futures: the interplay of sincere and subjunctive technology affordances in peace mediation.,"Efforts to support the resolution of armed conflicts through the facilitation of peace negotiations and dialogues increasingly involve digital technologies. While traditionally perceived as a human-centered activity, peace mediation now commonly entails information- and data-driven methods to enhance talks, support the analysis of conflict stakeholder needs and interests, and ground mediation efforts in better evidence. Digital technologies also promise to make peace efforts more future-oriented by helping to predict or anticipate upcoming developments, build scenarios, and increase readiness for emerging challenges. However, little is known about how such methods can be employed in dialogue and negotiation settings, where participants may have subjective and incompatible views on the conflict context, and more data and evidence don't necessarily help to determine what a more peaceful future could look like. Through a qualitative study of the use of digitally enhanced dialogue efforts in Yemen and Libya, we demonstrate that future-oriented peacemaking requires the balancing of 'sincere' technology affordances that encourage an engagement with the past and present reality of conflict, with 'subjunctive' technology affordances that encourage an engagement with possible futures that are more peaceful. In practice, this requires combining data- and evidence-generating methods concerned with the world 'as is' with data analysis and visualization methods concerned with how the world 'should' or 'could' be. Our findings have implications for the study of digital methods in the facilitation of contentious political processes where the provision of data and evidence may create hurting deadlocks.",20240901,"Hirblinger, Andreas T. ; Brummer, Ville ; Kufus, Felix",Article,Academic Journal,Sep2024,true,"Information, Communication & Society",Digital technology ; Data visualization ; Peace negotiations ; Stakeholder analysis ; Negotiation,JOUR,,,1369-118X,,,,,eng,Taylor & Francis Ltd,2058,2039,20,27,11,10.1080/1369118X.2023.2247070,,5BA,,https://research.ebsco.com/linkprocessor/plink?id=133283ff-250d-3c3b-bbf3-9c5b4552fc97
"Library, Information Science & Technology Abstracts",lxh,186775604,'Let's purchase coloured live chat messages': the impact of user engagement with Super Chat on YouTube.,"This research addresses the ways users engage with Super Chat in YouTube live streams and the impact of Super Chat on user participation in real-time communities. Super Chat is a feature available in YouTube live streams that enables users to purchase a highlighted comment and helps users gain visibility among peer audiences. While existing research mainly examined Super Chat's economic implications for YouTube's development of the digital economy, this article, from a sociocultural perspective, critically analyses the ways users engage with Super Chat and the impact of Super Chat on user participation and inclusiveness. Adopting the theoretical framework from participatory culture and the affordance approach, I used digital ethnography of user engagement with the top ten most super-chatted accounts in the UK for three months and semi-structured interviews with 23 participants. According to the amount of money spent on Super Chat, viewers of live streams were stratified and distinguished by different colours of chats, which created a visibility hierarchy of paid and non-paid viewers in live communities. Thus, this study argues that Super Chat in live streams, to some extent, benefits users when they harness the feature to fulfil cultural capacities (e.g., sociality, information acquisition, and the power of discourse), whereas user participation with Super Chat indicates the rationalisation of consuming inequalities, which perpetuates hierarchical online communities under the disguise of entertainment. This article contributes to human-technology interaction research in live streams and offers practical implications for platforms and content creators to facilitate inclusive online communities.",20250701,"Lin, Hui",Article,Academic Journal,Jul2025,true,"Information, Communication & Society",Virtual communities ; Audience participation ; Social hierarchies ; Participant observation ; Participatory culture ; Live streaming ; YouTube (Web resource),JOUR,,,1369-118X,,,,,eng,Taylor & Francis Ltd,1626,1608,19,28,9,10.1080/1369118X.2024.2442407,,5BA,,https://research.ebsco.com/linkprocessor/plink?id=8243e331-9a4f-3f6a-b29c-c5e078d54171

This paper provides a communicological formalization of digital preservation success. Design/methodology/approach: Digital preservation is repositioned as semiotic sense-making unfolding across archival timespans and accompanying cultural as well as technical distance, and not just as persistent data management. Findings: Inherent intersubjective contingency of any use of preserved information objects necessitates multivalent consideration of various communicative qualities, experiential affordances and artifactual characteristics for the comprehensive determination of preservation success. Research limitations/implications: The proposed conceptual framework provides a foundation for subsequent development of evaluative best practice recommendations.

"Library, Information Science & Technology Abstracts",lxh,144771037,"Testing the ""(Neo-)Darwinian"" Principles against Reticulate Evolution: How Variation, Adaptation, Heredity and Fitness, Constraints and Affordances, Speciation, and Extinction Surpass Organisms and Species.","Variation, adaptation, heredity and fitness, constraints and affordances, speciation, and extinction form the building blocks of the (Neo-)Darwinian research program, and several of these have been called ""Darwinian principles"". Here, we suggest that caution should be taken in calling these principles Darwinian because of the important role played by reticulate evolutionary mechanisms and processes in also bringing about these phenomena. Reticulate mechanisms and processes include symbiosis, symbiogenesis, lateral gene transfer, infective heredity mediated by genetic and organismal mobility, and hybridization. Because the ""Darwinian principles"" are brought about by both vertical and reticulate evolutionary mechanisms and processes, they should be understood as foundational for a more pluralistic theory of evolution, one that surpasses the classic scope of the Modern and the Neo-Darwinian Synthesis. Reticulate evolution moreover demonstrates that what conventional (Neo-)Darwinian theories treat as intra-species features of evolution frequently involve reticulate interactions between organisms from very different taxonomic categories. Variation, adaptation, heredity and fitness, constraints and affordances, speciation, and extinction therefore cannot be understood as ""traits"" or ""properties"" of genes, organisms, species, or ecosystems because the phenomena are irreducible to specific units and levels of an evolutionary hierarchy. Instead, these general principles of evolution need to be understood as common goods that come about through interactions between different units and levels of evolutionary hierarchies, and they are exherent rather than inherent properties of individuals.",20200701,"Gontier, Nathalie",Article,Academic Journal,Jul2020,true,Information,Horizontal gene transfer ; Heredity ; Genetic speciation ; Mobile genetic elements ; Evolutionary theories ; Physiological adaptation ; Species hybridization,JOUR,,,2078-2489,,,,,eng,MDPI,,352,,11,7,10.3390/info11070352,,B74H,,https://research.ebsco.com/linkprocessor/plink?id=dc5ba1b8-b14f-3c8b-b169-f29190dff10f
"Library, Information Science & Technology Abstracts",lxh,143555674,Negativity decontaminating: Communication media affordances for emotion regulation strategies.,"A challenging part of many occupations is dealing with negative emotions from customers, coworkers and other communication partners on a daily basis. This paper describes a case-based, inductive study of information technology (IT) help-desk workers within a Fortune 500 energy company and the communication media and emotion regulation strategies (ERSs) they employ for dealing with negative emotions from communication partners. Using the technology affordance perspective as the theoretical lens to understand the role of communication media, the present study is the first of its kind to document empirically how employees and management can leverage communication media to ease the strain of emotion regulation upon members and the IT help-desk group—an original concept we label negativity decontaminating. Here, individuals' technologically enabled ERSs are metaphorically likened to the techniques used by medical workers to avoid contamination from viruses. This negativity decontaminating potential includes several media affordances existing at two levels: a group level affordance (negativity filtering) and individual level affordances (negativity isolating , negativity barriering , and negativity containing). Moreover, the tech-organizational contexts at the case organization gave rise to a set of conditions that affected the exercising and actualization of media's negativity decontaminating potential. • Communication media facilitate emotion regulation via affording negativity decontaminating. • Negativity decontaminating affordances exist at the individual and group levels. • Negativity decontaminating affordances include filtering, isolating, barriering and containing. • Tech-organizational context affects the exercising and actualization of negativity decontaminating. • Tech-organizational context may be stimulating and inhibiting, releasing and suppressing.",20200601,"Wang, Nan (Tina) ; Carte, Traci A. ; Bisel, Ryan S.",Article,Academic Journal,Jun2020,true,Information & Organization,Emotions ; Personnel management ; Fortune 500 companies,JOUR,,,1471-7727,,,,,eng,Elsevier B.V.,N.PAG,N.PAG,,30,2,10.1016/j.infoandorg.2020.100299,,JG1,,https://research.ebsco.com/linkprocessor/plink?id=e5977fac-8706-32fa-bb49-33078031f721
"Library, Information Science & Technology Abstracts",lxh,178533656,Friend-connecting affordances: playing online games to contact friends.,"Purpose: Online games are popular applications of Internet technology, with over 2.8 billion users worldwide. Many players engage in team gameplay, indicating that online games are suitable media through which players connect with their friends. However, past studies have not examined the ability of games to assist players in connecting with their friends, indicating a gap. To fill this gap, the authors propose a new concept, the friend-connecting affordance, which is the ability of an online game to enable players to contact friends within the game. Design/methodology/approach: The authors built a model to explain how games' friend-connecting affordances influence game loyalty. The authors gathered responses from 1,347 online players and used structural equation modeling to test the model. Findings: The authors found that friend-connecting affordances and team participation influence game loyalty. Gaming intensity and gaming history can moderate the impact of friend-connecting affordances. Originality/value: This new affordance can be realized through various game elements, offering unique and actionable insights to game makers.

"Library, Information Science & Technology Abstracts",lxh,183597087,Intergroup ethnocentrism and social media: evidence from three Western democracies.,"Mass media have long been known to be deeply linked to ethnocentrism and its consequences. Attitudes towards ethnic outgroups are shaped by news agendas, framing, and tone at least as much or more than by the realities of immigration. By contrast, comparatively little is known about social media and interethnic contact. Unlike mass news, the interactive features of social media use can combine information with a direct interethnic contact. This creates an online public sphere which has the potential of being ethnically more diverse than the offline public sphere. By reviewing and connecting the literature on intergroup contact and online political communication, the given study attempts to connect the optimal intergroup contact theory by Gordon Allport to the realities and affordances of social media. The empirical analysis relies on a three-country survey with 4532 respondents in France, the United Kingdom, and the United States. Mindful of the endogeneity problem in our cross-cutting data, we perform propensity score matching and find that spending more time on X (formerly Twitter) is correlated with lower intergroup ethnocentrism under randomized conditions. No such effect was found for Facebook. We also find that people who discuss politics with those that have different ethnicity or race via social media (or offline) are less ethnocentric.",20250315,"Gelovani, Shota ; Theocharis, Yannis ; Koc-Michalska, Karolina ; Bimber, Bruce",Article,Academic Journal,Mar2025,true,"Information, Communication & Society",Social media ; Contact hypothesis (Sociology) ; Political communication ; Propensity score matching ; Racial & ethnic attitudes ; Mindfulness ; Ethnocentrism,JOUR,,,1369-118X,,,,,eng,Taylor & Francis Ltd,615,597,19,28,4,10.1080/1369118X.2024.2375259,,5BA,,https://research.ebsco.com/linkprocessor/plink?id=1fa468ea-74a5-3aab-b8b4-b4d26e4fc88a

These accounts offered a resistance-focused narrative about the administration. In this paper, we ask who the people are that ran these accounts, what their goals or purposes were during this time, and how they used Twitter to achieve their goals. To answer these questions, we conducted twelve interviews with some of the individuals behind the accounts and descriptively analyzed 43,569 tweets generated by these 102 accounts during the first 100 days of the Trump presidency. We discovered that not all accounts were not actually being run by agency employees, and that the account administrators had goals of creating a network of ""resistance"" by sharing scientific information, correcting misinformation, and contributing to the news cycle. They relied on the referentiality that Twitter affords through its features to expand beyond 140 characters to do this. • Analyzed 43 k tweets from 100+ ""rogue"" government agency Twitter accounts. • Conducted 12 interviews with ""rogue"" Twitter account authors. • Authors sought solidarity, to promote ""resistance"" to Trump agenda, contribute to news. • Twitter's affordances were essential to realizing the accounts' goals. • Referentiality was especially critical for maintaining resistance networks.",20200701,"Oltmann, Shannon M. ; Cooper, Troy B. ; Proferes, Nicholas",Article,Academic Journal,Jul2020,true,Government Information Quarterly,"Information dissemination ; Government agencies ; Public officers ; Accounting ; Trump, Donald, 1946-",JOUR,,,0740-624X,,,,,eng,Elsevier B.V.,N.PAG,N.PAG,,37,3,10.1016/j.giq.2020.101475,,GIQ,,https://research.ebsco.com/linkprocessor/plink?id=91e493c5-54cc-339f-95e3-9e30ee7a81db
"Library, Information Science & Technology Abstracts",lxh,181712667,"""That looks like something I would do"": understanding humanities researchers' digital hoarding behaviors in digital scholarship.","Purpose: In the era of digital intelligence, individuals are increasingly interacting with digital information in their daily lives and work, and a growing phenomenon known as digital hoarding is becoming more prevalent. Prior research suggests that humanities researchers have unique and longstanding information interaction and management practices in the digital scholarship context. This study therefore aims to understand how digital hoarding manifests in humanities researchers' behavior, identify the influencing factors associated with it, and explore how they perceive and respond to digital hoarding behavior. Design/methodology/approach: Qualitative research methods enable us to acquire a rich insight and nuanced understanding of digital hoarding practices. In this study, semi-structured interviews were conducted with 20 humanities researchers who were pre-screened for a high propensity for digital hoarding. Thematic analyses were then used to analyze the interview data. Findings: Three main characteristics of digital hoarding were identified. Further, the research paradigm, digital affordance, and personality traits and habits, collectively influencing the emergence and development of digital hoarding behaviors, were examined. The subtle influence of traditional Chinese culture was encountered. Interestingly, this study found that humanists perceive digital hoarding as a positive expectation (associated with inspiration, aesthetic pursuit, and uncertainty avoidance). Meanwhile, humanists' problematic perception of this behavior is more widely observed — they experience what we conceptualize as an ""expectation-perception"" gap. Three specific information behaviors related to avoidance were identified as aggravating factors for digital hoarding. Originality/value: The findings deepen the understanding of digital hoarding behaviors and personal information management among humanities researchers within the LIS field, and implications for humanities researchers, digital scholarship service providers, and digital tool developers are discussed.",20250101,"Jia, Mingxia ; Zhao, Yuxiang Chris ; Zhang, Xiaoyu ; Wu, Dawei",Article,Academic Journal,2025,true,Journal of Documentation,Personal information management ; Digital technology ; Compulsive hoarding ; Scholarly method ; Research personnel ; Habit,JOUR,,,0022-0418,,,,,eng,Emerald Publishing Limited,55,24,32,81,1,10.1108/JD-01-2024-0004,,GRF,,https://research.ebsco.com/linkprocessor/plink?id=721f0516-6b84-3c18-90c7-3876c7a9bec4

To answer this question, I analyze over 2,500 pages of trial transcripts for a keystone case in the use of digital surveillance at trial. Much like its use on both the front- and back-end of the criminal justice system, I find that it is used to link past actions to future ones. However, unlike previous research, I show that these conclusions are not drawn from actuarial modeling. Instead, the data are used to reveal – or refute – the defendant's true or innate self, free of outside influence. I identify five characteristics of digital evidence that are used to speak to both past criminal propensity, before clear signs of criminal intent emerge, or what I term criminal retrojection, and to future criminal engagement, or criminal projection. By examining the social capabilities, or affordances, ascribed to digital evidence in the adjudication process, we see how these data do more than sort an ever-growing pool of 'risky' individuals.

"Library, Information Science & Technology Abstracts",lxh,164896412,Visual media literacy and ethics: Images as affordances in the digital public sphere.,"This article argues for the adoption of an affordance model for media literacy. Media literacy efforts have largely evolved separately from visual literacy programs, neglecting the role of the photographic image in the digital public sphere. The hyper-visuality of media today demands closer attention to visuals in media literacy efforts because individuals cognitively process images differently. Images are more emotionally powerful and memorable than words. For these reasons, visual communication cannot be treated in parallel with words. Conceiving of visuals in media as artifacts used by messengers instead of independent messages supports media literacy's goals of helping individuals navigate today's digital environment. While such an approach is not the only way to understand images, the affordance paradigm cultivates discourse that supports media literacy.

These games, such as ""The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild"" and ""The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom,"" allow players to experience a sense of freedom and autonomy, which can reduce stress and improve mental health. While previous research has examined the general impact of video games on mental well-being, specific studies on the effects of open-world games among postgraduate students are limited. Objective: This study aims to investigate the relationships between cognitive escapism provided by open-world games and their effects on relaxation and well-being. The goal was to understand how the immersive nature of these games contributes to stress reduction and overall mental health improvement among postgraduate students. Methods: A mixed methods approach was used, which involved in-depth exploratory qualitative interviews and a survey of 609 players of popular open-world games. Quantitative data were collected using standardized questionnaires to measure open-world games' affordance of cognitive escapism, relaxation, and well-being. Qualitative data were obtained through 32 in-depth interviews that explored players' experiences and perceptions of cognitive escapism, relaxation, and mental well-being. Results: Qualitative data (n=32; n=15, 47% female; n=16, 50% male; n=1, 3% preferred not to disclose gender; mean age 23.19, SD 2.19 y) revealed that cognitive escapism through immersive game worlds allowed players to temporarily disconnect from real-world stressors, resulting in enhanced mood and psychological well-being. Players indicated that the nonlinear gameplay and freedom to explore interactive environments provided a sense of relaxation and mental rejuvenation. Quantitative analysis (N=609) showed a substantial mediating role of relaxation in the relationship between cognitive escapism offered by open-world games and well-being. Specifically, cognitive escapism had a significant positive effect on players' relaxation (β=.15; SE 0.04; P <.001; 95% CI 0.0695-0.2331), which in turn had a significant and positive effect on players' well-being scores (β=.12; SE 0.04; P =.002; 95% CI 0.0445-0.2032). Conclusions: The study demonstrates that open-world games offer substantial benefits for cognitive escapism, significantly improving relaxation and well-being among postgraduate students. The immersive and autonomous nature of these games is crucial in reducing stress and enhancing mental health.

"Library, Information Science & Technology Abstracts",lxh,181630982,Sensemaking of social media management: Seizing affordances in a dynamic complex environment.,"Background: Social Media (SM) growth and its acceptance at various economic levels are making it obligatory to make sense of its management in different business environments. A business environment can be volatile, uncertain, ambiguous, static-complex, simple-dynamic with a few similar, continuously changing factors, or simple-static with a few similar, unchanging factors. The environment is exemplified by the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, regional war, globalisation, the fourth industrial revolution and disruptive technology. Regulatory focus theory was used to examine whether managers adopt a prevention or promotion focus to SM use, shed light on employees' attitudes and whether regulatory focus affected the measures taken toward SM management. Objectives: The purpose of this paper was to explore how designed SM platforms can be managed in the face of dynamic and complex environments. Method: Experts' interviews from various organisations were selected using snowball sampling to gather qualitatively rich data. The data were analysed thematically using ATLAS.ti software. Results: Prevention through reengineering processes, increased use of algorithms, information technology (IT) investments and restricting SM to private use only were observed among experts. Additionally, promotion-focus managers allow employees to use SM for work-related tasks and use monitoring software.

"Library, Information Science & Technology Abstracts",lxh,180302022,Encoding Multilingualism: Technical Affordances of Multilingual Publication from Manuscripts to Unicode and OpenType.,"The landscape of publishing has undergone massive shifts, with new forms of technology increasing its speed and reach, while imposing new or different constraints on layout, format, and style. In this paper, we look at the impact of technology – from the manuscript to social media – on multilingual publishing. While earlier epochs of text technologies are fairly well addressed in academic literature, particularly with regard to their use in Western Europe, the computer age continues to be under-studied, not least due to the ephemerality of primary source material. In this paper, we draw on the Unicode Archives, housed in Stanford University's Special Collections. These archives include papers from Joe Becker, one of the founders of the Unicode standard, as well as Ken Whistler, Unicode Technical Director, the latter of whom preserved dozens of boxes of primary source materials that provide a first-hand look into the decisions that shaped modern multilingual computing. Using this archive, only made available to the public in summer 2023, we describe the rapidly-changing computing environment and its role in putting small-scale multilingual publishing into the hands of individuals and small groups in ways that were not previously imaginable. However, the internet and global text transmission introduced a series of complications that ultimately necessitated the Unicode standard. The history and development of the Unicode standard is poorly documented in scholarly literature, existing primarily in the gray literature of corporate documents and in the memory of those who experienced it. We will attempt to briefly cover this history in an accessible way that makes clear the underlying need, the major challenges, as well as the global impact. We will describe the current landscape of technology as it interfaces with multilingual publishing, including in modern forms such as social media. In doing so, we will also describe the social landscape of Unicode: the interplay between Unicode as a non-profit organization, and the corporations that it depends on to implement its standard. Finally, we will reflect on what ""publishers"" – defined very capaciously – have gained and lost in these technical shifts, pointing towards recent work towards creative font and text-input developments that can bring us closer to reclaiming some of the affordances lost to the computer age.",20240101,"Dombrowski, Quinn ; Goregaokar, Manish ; Joeng, Ben ; Kamran, Abeera",Article,Academic Journal,2024,true,Journal of Electronic Publishing,Grey literature ; Transmission of texts ; Social media ; Publishing ; Nonprofit organizations,JOUR,,,1080-2711,,,,,eng,Michigan Publishing,22,1,22,27,1,10.3998/jep.5528,,DO6,,https://research.ebsco.com/linkprocessor/plink?id=6ef2295d-fe81-3ca0-8287-6cf5d1d5586a
"Library, Information Science & Technology Abstracts",lxh,100837372,Patient-Reported Outcomes and Therapeutic Affordances of Social Media: Findings From a Global Online Survey of People With Chronic Pain.,"Background: Patient-reported outcomes (PROs) from social media use in chronic disease management continue to emerge. While many published articles suggest the potential for social media is positive, there is a lack of robust examination into mediating mechanisms that might help explain social media's therapeutic value. This study presents findings from a global online survey of people with chronic pain (PWCP) to better understand how they use social media as part of self-management. Objective: Our aim is to improve understanding of the various health outcomes reported by PWCP by paying close attention to therapeutic affordances of social media. We wish to examine if demographics of participants underpin health outcomes and whether the concept of therapeutic affordances explains links between social media use and PROs. The goal is for this to help tailor future recommendations for use of social media to meet individuals' health needs and improve clinical practice of social media use. Methods: A total of 231 PWCP took part in a global online survey investigating PROs from social media use. Recruited through various chronic disease entities and social networks, participants provided information on demographics, health/pain status, social media use, therapeutic affordances, and PROs from use. Quantitative analysis was performed on the data using descriptive statistics, cross-tabulation, and cluster analysis. Results: The total dataset represented 218 completed surveys. The majority of participants were university educated (67.0%, 146/218) and female (83.9%, 183/218). More than half (58.7%, 128/218) were married/partnered and not working for pay (75.9%, 88/116 of these due to ill health). Fibromyalgia (46.6%, 55/118) and arthritis (27.1%, 32/118) were the most commonly reported conditions causing pain. Participants showed a clear affinity for social network site use (90.0%, 189/210), followed by discussion forums and blogs. PROs were consistent, suggesting that social media positively impact psychological, social, and cognitive health. Analysis also highlighted two strong correlations linking platform used and health outcomes (particularly psychological, social, and cognitive) to (1) the narrative affordance of social media and (2) frequency of use of the platforms. Conclusions: Results did not uncover definitive demographics or characteristics of PWCP for which health outcomes are impacted. However, findings corroborate literature within this domain suggesting that there is a typical profile of people who use social media for health and that social media are more suited to particular health outcomes. Exploration of the relationship between social media's therapeutic affordances and health outcomes, in particular the narration affordance, warrants further attention by patients and clinicians.",20150101,"Merolli, Mark ; Gray, Kathleen ; Martin-Sanchez, Fernando ; Lopez-Campos, Guillermo",Article,Academic Journal,Jan2015,true,Journal of Medical Internet Research,Internet surveys ; Social media in medicine ; Health services accessibility ; Chronic pain treatment ; Evaluation of medical care,JOUR,,,1439-4456,,,,,eng,JMIR Publications Inc.,1,1,1,17,1,10.2196/jmir.3915,,DNC,,https://research.ebsco.com/linkprocessor/plink?id=933c0548-20d1-37a1-b690-cbb6b8097939
"Library, Information Science & Technology Abstracts",lxh,102913944,Therapeutic Affordances of Social Media: Emergent Themes From a Global Online Survey of People With Chronic Pain.,"Background: Research continues to present tenuous suggestions that social media is well suited to enhance management of chronic disease and improve health outcomes. Various studies have presented qualitative reports of health outcomes from social media use and have examined discourse and communication themes occurring through different social media. However, there is an absence of published studies examining and unpacking the underlying therapeutic mechanisms driving social media’s effects. Objective: This paper presents a qualitative analysis thoroughly describing what social media therapeutically affords people living with chronic pain who are self-managing their condition. From this therapeutic affordance perspective, we aim to formulate a preliminary conceptual model aimed at better understanding ""how"" social media can influence patient outcomes. Methods: In total, 218 people with chronic pain (PWCP) completed an online survey, investigating patient-reported outcomes (PROs) from social media use. Supplementary to quantitative data collected, participants were also given the opportunity to provide further open commentary regarding their use of social media as part of chronic pain management; 68/218 unique users (31.2%) chose to provide these free-text responses. Through thematic content analysis, 117 free-text responses regarding 10 types of social media were coded. Quotes were extracted and tabulated based on therapeutic affordances that we had previously identified. Inductive analysis was then performed to code defining language and emergent themes central to describing each affordance. Three investigators examined the responses, developed the coding scheme, and applied the coding to the data. Results: We extracted 155 quotes from 117 free-text responses. The largest source of quotes came from social network site users (78/155, 50.3%). Analysis of component language used to describe the aforementioned affordances and emergent themes resulted in a final revision and renaming of therapeutic affordances: ""exploration"" (52/155, 33.5% of quotes), ""connection"" (50/155, 32.3% of quotes), ""narration"" (33/155, 21.3% of quotes), ""adaptation"" (13/155, 8.4% of quotes), and ""self-presentation"" (7/155, 4.5% of quotes). Of the most described affordances, ""exploration"" was based on a propensity for participants to explain their social media use for information seeking purposes. ""Connection"" placed greater emphasis on interaction, highlighting themes of ""exchanging information"" and ""mitigating isolation"". Responses regarding ""narration"" highlighted the value of shared experiences and the emotionally cathartic role this plays. Conclusions: Much of the efficacy of social media may be explicable via a closer examination of therapeutic affordances. Particular areas that warrant attention include social media’s ability to filter and guide people to useful information, connect individuals, and share experiences. Further research into a variety of chronic conditions is warranted. Coupled with the results of the present study, a greater theoretical basis detailing how social media may foster health outcomes may lead to an improved evidence base for conducting research and may inform recommendations for social media use in chronic disease management.",20141201,"Merolli, Mark ; Gray, Kathleen ; Martin-Sanchez, Fernando",Article,Academic Journal,Dec2014,true,Journal of Medical Internet Research,,JOUR,,,1439-4456,,,,,eng,JMIR Publications Inc.,15,e284,,16,12,10.2196/jmir.3494,,DNC,,https://research.ebsco.com/linkprocessor/plink?id=4523a23c-632d-3f3c-9acd-42db30769f40

Specifically, we compare the content and style of parties' Facebook posts during the 2014 European parliament elections, and how this affects followers' responses in terms of liking, sharing and commenting on the posts. Our findings reveal while that the timing and visual content of posts are important in increasing voters' attention, interactivity matters most. Responsive party posts on Facebooks are significantly more likely to be shared, liked, and commented on by users. Given that follower reactions, particularly sharing, helps to increase the visibility of party communication through indirect or two-step flow communication (online and offline), these findings are important in advancing our understanding of how and why social media campaigns are able to influence voters and thus affect election outcomes. For parties themselves the results provide some useful insights into what makes for an 'effective' Facebook campaign in terms of how they can accelerate the reach of their communication.",20210401,"Koc-Michalska, Karolina ; Lilleker, Darren G. ; Michalski, Tomasz ; Gibson, Rachel ; Zajac, Jan M.",Article,Academic Journal,Apr-Jun2021,true,Journal of Information Technology & Politics,Social media ; Political parties ; Elections ; Political communication ; Political campaigns,JOUR,,,1933-1681,,,,,eng,Taylor & Francis Ltd,193,180,14,18,2,10.1080/19331681.2020.1837707,,3AFS,,https://research.ebsco.com/linkprocessor/plink?id=c0f390ce-cca8-3ba9-b30e-c9aaceb875b1

In this paper, we extend the concept of affordance to cover human-to-human communication and propose the novel concept of 'human affordance', which is afforded from humans, not artefacts. As one possible utilisation of the concept, we introduce the example of affordance in evaluating the strength of agreement/disagreement phrases. In text-based communication, it is important for mutual understanding to effectively afford information about how a person feels about the text itself.

Design/methodology/approach: This paper is formulated as a conceptual argument. It makes the case for the utility of considering relevance to be function of use in creative processes. Findings: There are several corollaries to formulating relevance as a function of use. These include the idea that objects by themselves cannot be relevant since use assumes interaction; the affordances of objects and how they are perceived can affect what becomes relevant but are not in themselves relevant; relevance is not an essential characteristic of objects; relevance is transient; potential relevance (what might be relevant in the future) can be distinguished from what is relevant in use and from what has been relevant in the past. Originality/value: The paper shows that its new formulation of relevance brings improved conceptual and terminological clarity to the discourse about relevance in information science. It demonstrates that how relevance is articulated conceptually is important as its conceptualization can affect the ways that users are able to make use of information systems and, by extension, how information systems can facilitate or disable the co-production of creative outcomes.

"Library, Information Science & Technology Abstracts",lxh,176479292,Stickiness formation among mobile apps of different social levels: multigroup analysis using the cognitive–affective–conative framework.,"Purpose: This study aims to reveal how mobile app stickiness is formed and how the stickiness formation process differs for apps of different social levels. Design/methodology/approach: This study proposed and validated a stickiness formation model following the cognitive–affective–conative framework. Data were collected from surveys of 1,240 mobile app users and analyzed using structural equation modeling. Multigroup analysis was applied to contrast the stickiness formation process among apps of different social levels. Findings: This study revealed a causal link between cognitive, affective and conative factors. It found partial mediation effects of trust in the association between perceptions and satisfaction, and the full mediation role of satisfaction and personal investment (PI) in the effects of subjective norm (SN) on stickiness. The multigroup analysis results suggested that social media affordances benefit stickiness through increased PI and strengthened effects of SN on PI. However, it damages stickiness through increased perceived privacy risk (PPR), decreased trust and strengthened effects of PPR on trust. Originality/value: This study contributes to both stickiness scholars and practitioners, as it builds a model to understand the stickiness formation process and reveals the effects of the ""go social"" strategy. The novelty of this study is that it examined social influences, considered privacy issues and revealed two mediation mechanisms. The findings can guide the improvement of mobile app stickiness and the application of the ""go social"" strategy.",20240501,"Zhou, Xingchen ; Rau, Pei-Luen Patrick ; Jie, Zhuoni",Article,Academic Journal,2024,true,Information Technology & People,Affective computing ; Satisfaction ; Structural equation modeling ; Trust ; Social influence,JOUR,,,0959-3845,,,,,eng,Emerald Publishing Limited,1228,1208,21,37,3,10.1108/ITP-05-2022-0358,,67S,,https://research.ebsco.com/linkprocessor/plink?id=bf3de91b-9904-361c-a3c6-8405da0fab4b

The PAR (Possibility, Action, Result) framework is based on the theoretical concepts of IS artifacts, affordances, and the capability approach, and is further refined by findings from an eGovernment project in Indonesia aiming to develop a digital platform to facilitate inclusive public debate for the citizens. The framework describes the process by which IS artifacts enable various action possibilities and choices. Furthermore, the framework shows how actors may realize their possibilities and choices, which in turn enhances their functioning. Our analysis also revealed the role of conversion factors, such as personal commitment and digital literacy, that hindered the actors' ability to actualize the possibilities of ICT. We make three main contributions. First, the PAR framework explains the process by which ICT can enhance individual and collective capabilities. Second, the concept of IS artifacts describes the perception of ICT possibilities and choices in the ICT4D context.

Data were drawn from 385 social media users in Nigeria, and Partial Least Squares (PLS) was used to analyse the data. We found that news-find-me perception, information overload, trust in online information, status seeking, self-expression and information sharing predicted fake news sharing related to COVID-19 pandemic among social media users in Nigeria. Greater effects of news-find-me perception and information overload were found on fake news sharing behaviour as compared to trust in online information, status seeking, self-expression and information sharing. Theoretically, our study enriches the current literature by focusing on the affordances of social media and the abundance of online information in predicting fake news sharing behaviour among social media users, especially in Nigeria.

Design/methodology/approach: Drawing on the consumption value framework and affordance theory, the present study argues that in-game purchase behaviors are determined by multiple consumption values of in-game items. The perceptions of consumption values were influenced by game affordances. The model was tested, using data from an empirical survey with 2,006 free-to-play game players.

This study examines factors influencing YouTube SDL based on the personal responsibility orientation (PRO) model. In addition, the two markets, US and Taiwan, were chosen to explore if national cultural differences affect YouTube users' SDL frequency and goals along with PRO variables. Design/methodology/approach: A self-administered online survey of 372 college aged-YouTube users in the US and Taiwan was conducted to obtain the self-reported SDL behavior on YouTube and other demographic and video usage variable information. Findings: Frequent video sharing and information seeking motives likely facilitate general YouTube SDL, while initiating online video search leads to specific goal-oriented SDL such as problem-solving and skill-improvement. Although American students use YouTube more frequently for SDL than Taiwanese students, Taiwanese students use YouTube more for specific skill improvement. Social implications: YouTube's social affordance enables YouTube users' informal and SDL across different national cultures and thus the role such social media play in encouraging lifelong learning needs further attention. Originality/value: This study contributes to understanding how YouTube fosters the informal learning process through functions enabling YouTube users' self-directed information seeking, sharing and engaging with online videos with a cross-national comparison.

For the sustainable growth of social Q&A sites, maintaining askers is as critical as maintaining answerers. Based on motivational affordances theory and self‐determination theory, this study explores the influence of the design elements of social Q&A sites (i.e., upvotes, downvotes, edits, user profile, and comments) on the survival of new askers. In addition, the moderating effect of having an alternative experience is examined. Online data on 25,000 new askers from the top five Q&A sites in the Technology category of the Stack Exchange network are analyzed using logistic regression. The results show that the competency‐ and autonomy‐related design features of social Q&A sites motivate new askers to continue participating.

Value propositions identify how public organizations use e‐Government to fulfill citizens' needs across different roles. Using a concept‐centric systematic review, we identified such value propositions as effective public organizations, quality service delivery, open government and democratic values, as well as social values and well‐being. We chose some selected e‐Government projects in Nigeria and Rwanda; adopted realist evaluation (RE) multiple case studies as a methodology and introduced affordance actualization, self‐determination theory, and sustainability framework for e‐Government success as theoretical lenses. To collect data, we adopted a mixed method RE approach and used a contingent valuation method (CVM) as a quantitative aspect to identify the actualized value propositions in operations in the implemented e‐Government projects in Nigeria and Rwanda as outcomes. Sequentially followed by a realist interview as a qualitative approach to collect and analyze data we uncovered the generative mechanisms causing such outcomes to exist and be sustainable. Our findings revealed technological cognizance and autonomy as well as competence as individual mechanisms identified for sustaining such outcomes. While organizational mechanisms revealed are continuous availability of funds, institutional, administrative, and coordinating capacity with leadership and political support. Other organizational mechanisms include institutionalizing the technology within local settings with ongoing monitoring and improvement evaluation enabled by both internal and external contextual conditions.

"Library, Information Science & Technology Abstracts",lxh,164454642,Evolution of digital activism on social media: opportunities and challenges.,"The social media revolution has affected all areas, including activism. However, there is scepticism about its emancipatory capacity, and it is considered by some to be a distorted form of activism. This article presents a review of the existing literature on digital activism, starting with the concept itself, and examines its impact on the organisation of activists and citizen participation. Likewise, based on the platformisation of these spaces and the evolution of their affordances, we observe a growth in individual, strategic and low-commitment participation, the accentuation of the role of emotions in media that promote virality, and the assumption of playful forms of politainment by activists -especially on TikTok-. On the other hand, the strategies carried out by organisations to promote activism in relation to their causes are investigated, such as the generation of arguments provided by the interest group and the involvement in an action of dissemination, co-creation and replication of activists. Finally, the main challenges of digital activism are indicated: the growing inequality in terms of access to algorithmic visibility between activists and brands, influencers and interest groups; the desirability of complementing playful activism with work in alternative digital media that allows for more stable forms of collaboration; and the need to protect activists against the growth of hate speech on these platforms.",20230501,"Castillo-Esparcia, Antonio ; Caro-Castaño, Lucía ; Almansa-Martínez, Ana",Article,Academic Journal,2023,true,El Profesional de la Información,Social media ; Activism ; Freedom of speech ; Political participation ; Hacktivism ; Online social networks ; Social revolution ; Alternative mass media,JOUR,,,1386-6710,,,,,eng,EPI SCP,16,1,16,32,3,10.3145/epi.2023.may.03,,EI0,,https://research.ebsco.com/linkprocessor/plink?id=93a839db-884b-342d-ade1-a7b6e7f93b17

Whom to ""friend"" and via which platform can involve complex deliberations. This study investigates the relationships between users' perceived friending affordances of five popular SNSs (Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, Snapchat and LinkedIn) and their friending behaviors concerning strong ties, weak ties (existing and latent ties) and parasocial ties. Design/methodology/approach: An online survey using Qualtrics was provided to participants (N = 626) through Amazon's Mechanical Turk (MTurk). The survey asked their SNS use and their friending behaviors with different ties on each of the sites. Findings: Users' friending decisions are dependent on an interplay of socio-technical affordances of each SNS and specific needs for the ties. The authors found that the affordances of bridging social capital and enjoyment are aligned with friending weak and parasocial ties, respectively. The affordances of bonding social capital were not valued to friend strong ties. Originality/value: The study extends the affordance and social capital literature by assessing users' perceived, contextualized SNS affordances in relation to actual communication behaviors in friending different social ties.

"Library, Information Science & Technology Abstracts",lxh,131901514,Affordances for sharing domain-specific and complex knowledge on enterprise social media.,"Highlights • The affordance of visibility eases the sharing of domain-specific knowledge. • The affordances of association and editability ease the sharing of complex knowledge. • There are significant interactions between affordances and knowledge attributes. • Enterprise social media could facilitate the sharing of domain-specific and complex knowledge. Abstract Many organizations have implemented enterprise social media (ESM) to better connect employees and promote knowledge sharing. Prior studies indicate that employees often use ESM to access knowledge in other domains or complex knowledge. But connecting employees is only part of the picture – while ESM offer the possibility of accessing domain specific and complex knowledge, the flow of such knowledge might remain inhibited by the perceived effort required to codify them for sharing. This study identifies salient ESM affordances that can alleviate the perceived effort of sharing domain-specific and complex knowledge. Results of a survey of 303 employees working in organizations using ESM indicate that domain-specific knowledge is perceived as less effortful to codify when the affordance of visibility is strong (i.e., the affordance negatively moderates the positive relationship between knowledge specificity and perceived codification effort), and complex knowledge is perceived as less effortful to codify when the affordances of association and editability are strong. These findings indicate that it is necessary to consider both knowledge attributes and ESM affordances and their interactions when understanding knowledge sharing using ESM.",20181201,"Pee, L.G.",Article,Academic Journal,Dec2018,true,International Journal of Information Management,Social media ; Knowledge transfer ; Information technology ; Financial services industry ; Motivation (Psychology),JOUR,,,0268-4012,,,,,eng,Elsevier B.V.,37,25,13,43,,10.1016/j.ijinfomgt.2018.05.006,,1LL,,https://research.ebsco.com/linkprocessor/plink?id=caa34b01-4fa5-32a1-a320-0b71e3d71ee8
"Library, Information Science & Technology Abstracts",lxh,181640836,Exploring the Incentive Function of Virtual Academic Degrees in a Chinese Online Smoking Cessation Community: Qualitative Content Analysis.,"Background: Previous studies on online smoking cessation communities (OSCCs) have shown how such networks contribute to members' health outcomes from behavior influence and social support perspectives. However, these studies rarely considered the incentive function of OSCCs. One of the ways OSCCs motivate smoking cessation behaviors is through digital incentives. Objective: This study aims to explore the incentive function of a novel digital incentive in a Chinese OSCC—the awarding of academic degrees—to promote smoking cessation. It specifically focuses on ""Smoking Cessation Bar,"" an OSCC in the popular web-based Chinese forum Baidu Tieba. Methods: We collected discussions about the virtual academic degrees (N= 1193) from 540 members of the ""Smoking Cessation Bar."" The time frame of the data set was from November 15, 2012, to November 3, 2021. Drawing upon motivational affordances theory, 2 coders qualitatively coded the data. Results: We identified five key topics of discussion, including members' (1) intention to get virtual academic degrees (n=38, 2.47%), (2) action to apply for the degrees (n=312, 20.27%), (3) feedback on the accomplishment of goals (n=203, 13.19%), (4) interpersonal interaction (n=794, 51.59%), and (5) expression of personal feelings (n=192, 12.48%). Most notably, the results identified underlying social and psychological motivations behind using the forum to discuss obtaining academic degrees for smoking cessation. Specifically, members were found to engage in sharing behavior (n=423, 27.49%) over other forms of interaction such as providing recommendations or encouragement. Moreover, expressions of personal feelings about achieving degrees were generally positive. It was possible that members hid their negative feelings (such as doubt, carelessness, and dislike) in the discussion. Conclusions: The virtual academic degrees in the OSCC created opportunities for self-presentation for participants. They also improved their self-efficacy to persist in smoking cessation by providing progressive challenges. They served as social bonds connecting different community members, triggering interpersonal interactions, and inducing positive feelings. They also helped realize members' desire to influence or to be influenced by others. Similar nonfinancial rewards could be adopted in various smoking cessation projects to enhance participation and sustainability.",20230101,"Qian, Yuxing ; Liu, Zhenghao ; Lee, Edmund W J ; Wang, Yixi ; Ni, Zhenni",Article,Academic Journal,2023,true,Journal of Medical Internet Research,Motivation (Psychology) ; Smoking cessation ; Goal (Psychology) ; Academic degrees ; Social bonds,JOUR,,,1439-4456,,,,,eng,JMIR Publications Inc.,13,1,13,25,1,10.2196/42260,,DNC,,https://research.ebsco.com/linkprocessor/plink?id=aedb521a-4aa1-39a4-bb6b-dc274621dddf

However, the majority of the gamified services fail to be financially sustainable. Existing freemium and gamified services literature provides scant knowledge on behavioral predictors of in-app purchases in freemium gamified services. The research examines highly interactive consumers' in-app behaviors using competition-based motivational affordances, daily usage behavior and social competition motivation that convert them into super engagers. Design/methodology/approach: The authors applied a multimethod approach by using Multivariate Logistic Regression (n = 685) to analyze in-app behavioral data and Qualitative Comparative Analysis (n = 94) to examine survey and in-app behavioral data of highly interactive consumers of a freemium gamified service to explain paying behaviors. Findings: Results reveal highly interactive consumers that elicit heavy daily usage of the application or excel at in-app challenges are less likely to convert to super engagers. Among super engagers, some are socially competitive, and their inability to advance in the leaderboard corresponds to in-app purchases, while non-socially competitive consumers make purchases to collect extrinsic rewards. Additionally, highly interactive consumers who possess more knowledge about the gamified service become super engagers to increase their chances to be socially competitive. Originality/value: This research examines in-app behaviors of highly interactive consumers of a freemium gamified service that lead to in-app purchases following varying levels of daily usage behavior and social competition motivation. The authors contribute to the previous literature by defining and examining a new consumer segment – super engagers – that is financially beneficial for freemium services because of their in-app purchases. The authors provide insight on in-app behaviors that convert highly interactive consumers to super engagers and demonstrate that the reason for highly interactive consumers to make in-app purchases is a function of acquiring specific internal and external rewards based on their level of social competition.",20221101,"Gupta, Keshav ; Su, Yiran ; Kunkel, Thilo ; Funk, Daniel",Article,Academic Journal,2022,true,Internet Research,Mobile apps ; Consumers ; Reward (Psychology) ; Customer loyalty ; Consumer behavior ; Logistic regression analysis,JOUR,,,1066-2243,,,,,eng,Emerald Publishing Limited,1909,1891,19,32,6,10.1108/INTR-07-2021-0434,,58X,,https://research.ebsco.com/linkprocessor/plink?id=f524177a-7afd-3726-a5eb-30feec0c006c

Extant research, however, rarely addresses the inclusive design of e-Government, which is the focus of our research. We focus on broad desire for inclusive e-Government design by analyzing data from three countries – United Kingdom, Lebanon, and Qatar – involving (a) a qualitative survey of users seeking their input on e-Government design improvements and (b) interviews with service providers to elicit their views on inclusive e-Government design. Our findings highlight that inclusion may begin with seeking design input only; however, once the process is triggered, it can lead to what we call a landscape of inclusive e-Government design. More importantly, our paper contributes to the literature by elaborating the granular underpinnings of this landscape encompassing an emergent mechanism of inclusive e-Government design that consists of the following three components: (i) the enabling social inclusion affordances; (ii) the supporting processes; and (iii) the enabling organizational capabilities.",20221001,"Azad, Bijan ; Zablith, Fouad",Article,Academic Journal,2022,true,Information Polity: The International Journal of Government & Democracy in the Information Age,Internet in public administration ; Lebanon ; Qatar ; Social integration,JOUR,,,1570-1255,,,,,eng,Sage Publications Inc.,453,433,21,27,4,10.3233/IP-220010,,KL4,,https://research.ebsco.com/linkprocessor/plink?id=169a124d-226c-3bc7-b150-053b636f1ef2

An online survey was conducted with 522 WeChat users in China. Structural equation modeling using the maximum likelihood of estimation was employed to test the study's hypothesized model. Bootstrapping methods were used to examine mediation effects. The results revealed that users' liking, sharing, and commenting behaviors were positively related to the bonding and bridging capital accumulated on WeChat. These two forms of social capital were also positively associated with users' psychological well-being, though bridging capital exerted more power in our research model. Moreover, both bonding and bridging capital mediated the relationship between WeChat affordances and psychological well-being. The findings shed new light on directions for leveraging mobile social media as an alternative means to bring about improvements in well-being in mobile-phone-saturated China. This is likely to be the first study that examines the mediating roles of bonding and bridging social capital on the relationship between users' health information engagement and users' psychological well-being.

"Library, Information Science & Technology Abstracts",lxh,152132127,What are political parties doing on TikTok? The Spanish case.,"TikTok, already widely used before the pandemic, boomed during the quarantine that locked down large parts of the world, reaching 2 billion downloads and 800 million monthly active users worldwide by the end of 2020. Of these 800 million users, 41% are aged between 16 and 24 years. This social network, widely known for its entertainment videos, is increasingly becoming a place for political discussion and therefore a unique opportunity for political actors to (re) connect with young people. Acknowledging that the political uses of TikTok are still understudied, this paper aims to explore whether and how Spanish political parties are including TikTok as part of their communication strategy. Through an affordance-centered content analysis of all the posts published by the five most important Spanish political parties (PP, PSOE, Ciudadanos, Podemos, and Vox), the current results show that, although all Spanish political parties have adopted this platform, their usage is unequal. From a quantitative perspective, PP was the first party to open a TikTok account, but its usage has been discontinuous; Podemos and Ciudadanos are the parties that publish the most and most constantly, while Vox has only published nine posts and the PSOE one. Nonetheless, from a qualitative perspective, Podemos and Vox generate more engagement and seem to understand and exploit TikTok's specific affordances better. The findings allow it to be concluded that, although globally Spanish political parties do not fully exploit the platform's affordances and tend to use it as a unilateral tool for promotion, the most engaging posts are those favoring interaction and geared toward politainment.",20210701,"Cervi, Laura ; Marín-Lladó, Carles",Article,Academic Journal,jul/ago2021,true,El Profesional de la Información,Spain ; Political parties ; Political communication ; Communication strategies ; Social networks ; TikTok (Web resource),JOUR,,,1386-6710,,,,,eng,EPI SCP,17,1,17,30,4,10.3145/epi.2021.jul.03,,EI0,,https://research.ebsco.com/linkprocessor/plink?id=49d20467-b793-3c4b-a9c2-d58301a2a954

It draws on two theoretical perspectives, communication privacy management theory and the technology affordance framework, as well as on empirical data in an attempt to paint a comprehensive picture of the factors shaping employees' decisions to share or not share information on enterprise social media. Design/methodology/approach: This qualitative field study is based on semi-structured interviews and enterprise social media review data from a large Nordic media organization. Findings: On an enterprise social media platform, privacy management principles shape employees' information-sharing decisions in relation to personal privacy boundaries, professional boundaries and assumed risks, online safety concerns and perceived audience. Additionally, the technological affordances of visibility, awareness, persistence and searchability shape employees' information sharing in varying and sometimes even contradictory ways. Finally, organizational factors, such as norms, tasks and media repertoires, are associated with employees' information-sharing decisions. Together, these three dimensions, personal, technological and organizational, form a model of the enablers of and constraints on employees' decisions to share information on enterprise social media. Originality/value: This study extends the understanding of different factors shaping employees' decisions to share or not share information on enterprise social media. It extends the two applied theories by uniquely combining interpersonal privacy management principles with a technological affordance framework that focuses on the relationship between the user and the technology. This research also furthers the authors' knowledge of what privacy management principles mean in the organizational context. This study shows connections between the two theories and extends the understanding of technology affordances as not only action possibilities but also constraining factors.

The objective of a current design science research (DSR) undertaking is, thus, the conceptualizing and prototyping of a PKM System (PKMS) aiming at departing from today's centralized institutional solutions and at strengthening individuals' sovereignty and collaborations, not at the expense of Organizational KM Systems, but rather as the means to foster a fruitful co-evolution. This article expands on a recent paper focussing on the PKMS's affordances in the context of the individual and collective, explicit and tacit knowledge of knowledge workers by integrating twelve renowned models of knowledge creation in a three-dimensional dynamic 'public-transport-like' map of holistically portrayed complementing work flows. In further detailing the impacts and benefits for a prospective PKMS user community, the article highlights the major radical changes of the PKM approach according to the decentralization, mobilization, accessibility, granularity, traceability, transdisciplinarity, transparency, diffusibility, negentropy, and synergies of knowledge. The results reaffirm the DSR concept of theory effectiveness aspired to in terms of the system's utility and communication as well as the PKMS as a sustainable intervention to confront opportunity divides independent of space (e.g., developed/developing countries), time (e.g., study or career phase), discipline (e.g., natural or social science), or role (e.g., student, professional, or leader).",20191201,"Schmitt, Ulrich",Article,Academic Journal,Dec2019,true,Electronic Journal of Knowledge Management,Knowledge management ; Knowledge workers ; Solution strengthening ; Tacit knowledge ; Workflow,JOUR,,,1479-4411,,,,,eng,Academic Conferences International,130,114,17,17,2,10.34190/EJKM.17.02.002,,RU7,,https://research.ebsco.com/linkprocessor/plink?id=c5e1bdef-b457-3780-ac04-4382ba09ad83

Drawing inspiration from the social bonding theory, the authors have proposed a moderated mediation model to explain how ESM affordances reduce cyberslacking, mediated significantly by workplace social bonding when the perceived co-worker involvement is high.

Findings: The findings show that workplace social bonding mediates the relationship between ESM affordances and cyberslacking. The results are also consistent with the moderated mediation model as the mediation is significant when the perceived co-worker involvement is high, and the mediation is insignificant when the moderator is low/moderate. Research limitations/implications: Considering the potential behavioural dynamics of ESM artefacts, the authors have introduced self-expression (via microblogging), recognition (from paralinguistic digital affordances) and network externality as ESM affordances.

The interviews revealed six use genres that go beyond the well-known convenience and entertainment. Specifically, the use genres of companionship, self-control and productivity, sleep aid, health care, peace of mind and increased accessibility emerged from participants' accounts.

"Library, Information Science & Technology Abstracts",lxh,139136397,Affording choice: how website designs create and constrain 'choice'.,"Nowadays, the web offers a world of choice, providing millions of options at the click of a button. Web-based platforms such as Amazon.com and Yelp.com provide users with a range of tools and functionalities to navigate and compare options within a complex and bewildering landscape of choice. Whilst such websites afford users the feeling of objective and 'free' choice, it is also clear that the design features and architecture of websites have strategic affordances for structuring choice in different ways and for particular aims and objectives. Based on a study of 500 top-ranking websites, in this paper, we argue for a re-evaluation of the relationship between choice and the web, through an examination of the affordances of websites for shaping and governing choice. Using illustrative examples and drawing on a conceptual framework from previous work, we examine four interconnected aspects of how choice is structured through the affordances of websites. We discuss the role of algorithms in governing choice through websites, including their role in drawing users into a political economy of choice-making that appears to 'nudge' them in particular directions. Websites not only constitute and structure choice, but also presuppose, deploy, and potentially (re)produce the characteristics and capacities of 'choosers', and as choosers are not equals this in turn may reproduce and reinforce social inequalities and fissures. The paper concludes with a reflection on the entangled trajectories of choice and web technologies, and how this might impact our understanding of choice in contemporary society.",20191201,"Graham, Timothy ; Henman, Paul",Article,Academic Journal,Dec2019,true,"Information, Communication & Society",Web design ; Websites ; Amazon.com Inc. ; Economics ; Modern society ; Architectural design,JOUR,,,1369-118X,,,,,eng,Taylor & Francis Ltd,2023,2007,17,22,13,10.1080/1369118X.2018.1476570,,5BA,,https://research.ebsco.com/linkprocessor/plink?id=8842a153-03ff-3042-8936-c30b4f7a1997

"Library, Information Science & Technology Abstracts",lxh,121004426,Mobility of knowledge work and affordances of digital technologies.,"The focus of this work arises from two needs within information science literature: (1) to understand more, from an empirically driven perspective, about the increasingly visible yet understudied mobile work population, and (2) to address more clearly, from a theoretical standpoint, the ways in which information and communication technologies (ICTs) mediate the work practices of these mobile workers. Drawing on the affordance perspective, this research goes beyond simplistic conceptualizations of technological effects to explore the roles of multiple ICTs in enabling mobile knowledge work. In this paper, the use of ICTs in mobilizing information practices and the ways in which ICTs generate affordances along different mobility dimensions (spatial, temporal, contextual, and social) are examined. The empirical base of this research is a field of study of 33 mobile knowledge workers (MKWs); broadly, it focuses on the ways they employ ICTs to accomplish work in dynamic and unpredictable work conditions.",20170401,"Nelson, Sarah Beth ; Jarrahi, Mohammad Hossein ; Thomson, Leslie",Article,Academic Journal,Apr2017,true,International Journal of Information Management,Information & communication technologies ; Digital technology ; Information theory ; Theory of knowledge ; Cell phones,JOUR,,,0268-4012,,,,,eng,Elsevier B.V.,62,54,9,37,2,10.1016/j.ijinfomgt.2016.11.008,,1LL,,https://research.ebsco.com/linkprocessor/plink?id=2c962b66-4d7b-3b14-83ab-7d3e3cbac464

Online support groups may provide a range of therapeutic affordances that may benefit these women.<bold>Objective: </bold>To examine the presence of therapeutic affordances as perceived by women who use endometriosis online support groups.<bold>Methods: </bold>Sixty-nine women (aged 19-50 years, mean 34.2 years; 65.2% (45/69) United Kingdom, 21.7% (15/69) United States) participated in a Web-based interview exploring online support group use. Participants had been using online support groups for an average of 2 years and 4 months (range = 1 month to 14 years, 9 months). Responses were analyzed using inductive thematic analysis.<bold>Results: </bold>The analysis revealed 4 therapeutic affordances related to online support group use: (1) ""connection,"" that is, the ability to connect in order to support each other, exchange advice, and to try to overcome feelings of loneliness; (2) ""exploration,"" that is, the ability to look for information, learn, and bolster their knowledge; (3) ""narration,"" that is, the ability to share their experiences, as well as read about the experiences of others; and (4) ""self-presentation,"" that is, the ability to manage how they present themselves online.

Ethnographic open-air museums are complex spaces with shared qualities of outdoor sites and indoor museums. Grounded in Gibson's theory of affordances (1979), the article explores how visitors interact within and in relation to the hybrid space of ethnographic open-air museum and how communication shapes their interactions. The analysis is based on a qualitative study of visitors in the Belarusian State Museum of Folk Architecture and Rural Lifestyle (Aziartso, Belarus) and the Open-Air Museum of Lithuania (Rumšiškės, Lithuania). The data were collected using participatory observation and semistructured interviews with visitors. The article employs a constructivist approach and conceptualizes an ethnographic museum as a free-choice environment, where behavior patterns are linked to the institutional context and the visitors' ability to perceive the information about the objects and environments that specified the possibilities and constraints for interacting with the museum's space. The study reveals how cultural communication fosters the diversity of visiting scenarios and the perceptions of ethnographic open-air museums as cultural heritage sites, natural parks and stages for entertainment.

"Library, Information Science & Technology Abstracts",lxh,135147248,On multiple agencies: when do things matter?,"The late twentieth century sociology began to recognise the performative role of technological artefacts in human lives. These objects enact their non-human agency by actions that human users cannot completely control. This paper critically assesses existing approaches that investigate the relation of human and non-human agencies (actor-network theory, the ventriloqual perspective on communication, contemporary affordance theory). The main focus of this article is the challenge of describing the performative influence of routine and invisible objects. By analysing existing approaches that employ the concepts of inscriptions and attachments, the paper argues that the ventriloqual perspective on communication is human-centered because it assesses the relevance of an object by pointing to a person's attitude to it (attachment). In turn, actor-network theory is object-centered as it emphasizes the visible performativity of technologies (inscriptions) and ignores the action possibilities provided by them. Meanwhile, contemporary affordance theory helps to extend the agency of things to their potential performances. Despite the shortcomings and merits of existing approaches, each of these frameworks employ multiple types of agencies without full acknowledgement. Using the examples of several empirical studies, the author shows that there is a lack of conceptual clarity when trying to account for the agency of routine and invisible objects. By reconciling the inscription and affordance perspectives, the author delineates four types of agencies that material objects can enact. In the conclusion, theoretical and methodological implications for future research are discussed.",20190501,"Erofeeva, Maria",Article,Academic Journal,May2019,true,"Information, Communication & Society",Ventriloquism ; Inscriptions ; Actor-network theory ; Ventriloquists' dummies ; Social sciences,JOUR,,,1369-118X,,,,,eng,Taylor & Francis Ltd,604,590,15,22,5,10.1080/1369118X.2019.1566486,,5BA,,https://research.ebsco.com/linkprocessor/plink?id=b6839489-71ac-36b6-b81f-6916b98b7c1b

Abstract Majority opinions are often observed in the process of social interaction in online communities, but few studies have addressed this issue with empirical data. To identify an appropriate theoretical lens for explaining majority opinions in online environments, this study investigates the skewness statistic, which indicates how many “Likes” are skewed to major comments on a Facebook post; 3489 posts are gathered from the New York Times Facebook page for 100 days. Results show that time is not an influential factor for skewness increase, but the number of comments has a logarithmic relation to skewness increase. Regression models and Chow tests show that this relationship differs depending on topic contents, but majority opinions are significant in overall. These results suggest that the bandwagon effect due to social affordance can be a suitable mechanism for explaining majority opinion formation in an online environment and that majority opinions in online communities can be misperceived due to overestimation.",20181101,"Lee, Sangwon ; Ha, Taehyun ; Lee, Daeho ; Kim, Jang Hyun",Article,Academic Journal,Nov2018,true,Information Processing & Management,Sentiment analysis ; Internet forums ; Online social networks ; Bandwagon effect ; Skewness (Probability theory) ; Empirical research ; Facebook (Web resource),JOUR,,,0306-4573,,,,,eng,Elsevier B.V.,1128,1115,14,54,6,10.1016/j.ipm.2018.08.002,,INM,,https://research.ebsco.com/linkprocessor/plink?id=3acd5acd-9a96-3e07-9b4b-6d381a11fcd4

In this study, we draw from Bourdieu's work on taste and capital to unravel how life coaches capitalize on the affordances of Instagram to generate legitimacy and credibility for their profession. Drawing from a one-month observation of 1,650 posts collected from 20 Instagram profiles of life coaches, our analysis provides insight into how these professionals strategically display and integrate cultural practices, tastes, and preferences that align with neoliberal ideals of self-improvement and self-responsibility to set themselves apart as experts within their field. They then use this distinctiveness as a marketing technique, thereby feeding off their cultural and social capital, among others by rationalizing their expertise by appealing to their own experiences, embedding client testimonials, and driving the narrative by combining hashtags or images that refer to self-entrepreneurism, self-responsibility, and the good life.

Artificial intelligence has the potential to revolutionize the way that scholars produce work, including through the creation of literature reviews using free or low-cost systems. Despite the importance of the literature review, AI-powered tools to create literature reviews are understudied at present. Method. To address this gap, four specialized tools were assessed. The complex area of study chosen was e-reading in English and Spanish, a field where differences are evident in the two languages. Systems were prompted to write a literature review of 500-1000 words, and the resulting outputs were analysed based on the requirements for reviews of the literature. Results. Although none of the systems allowed for all the identified criteria to be addressed, Scite allowed many criteria to be met and was able to produce text in Spanish as well as in English. The remaining three systems investigated, Jenni.ai, OpenRead, and Wisio, performed less favourably. Conclusions. AI-powered systems show incredible promise, with one unstudied area being the creation of scholarly reviews of the literature.

Investigating the organizing property of retributive vigilantism in a Reddit collective of websleuths.,"This paper investigates a collective of websleuths called the Reddit Bureau of Investigation (RBI) that contains over 70,000 members. Websleuthing, or the investigative practices undertaken online by individuals who are not professional security providers, is an increasing trend. While conducting investigations on Reddit constitutes somewhat of a transgressive practice, the online platform's history is intimately linked with websleuthing since the manhunt that followed the 2013 Boston attacks which received much criticism from its community. Thus, we seek to understand how the RBI organizes its investigative activities against an anti-vigilante backdrop. Drawing from organizational discourse theory, we analyze the discursive practices developed by RBI members to define and enforce the collective's mission and participatory guidelines. Specifically, we focus on the figures (memes, metaphors, rules, affects, etc.) that RBI members invoke in interaction and on the role of Reddit's affordances in the materialization of these discursive entities. Our analysis is threefold. First, we underline how figures associated with retributive vigilantism are invoked by moderators and their propension to circumscribe what (not) to do within the subreddit. Then, we analyze a series of controversial posts to identify the recurring discursive practices developed by users when asking the RBI for assistance. Finally, we explore the ambivalent rapport that RBI members maintain with the police. Overall, our analysis shows that members must overtly recognize police authority over criminal matters yet invoke the institution's limitations to justify their involvement in the RBI, all the while rejecting any association with retributive vigilantism.",20200301,"Myles, David ; Benoit-Barné, Chantal ; Millerand, Florence",Article,Academic Journal,Mar2020,true,"Information, Communication & Society",Virtual communities ; Boston (Mass.) ; Vigilance committees ; Discursive practices ; Armies ; Investigations,JOUR,,,1369-118X,,,,,eng,Taylor & Francis Ltd,336,317,20,23,3,10.1080/1369118X.2018.1502336,,5BA,,https://research.ebsco.com/linkprocessor/plink?id=da250eef-6af6-3b17-a12f-956fdf2e260a

"Library, Information Science & Technology Abstracts",lxh,182193999,'Why should we turn to fascists in their own language?' Affordances and constraints of networked counterpublics as experienced by the group members.,"The emergence of social networking sites (SNSs) and new media has led to scholarly interest in the possibilities they offer for creating counter publics - discursive arenas where subordinated groups invent and circulate counterdiscourses in opposition to the dominant ideology. However, most empirical research has focused on describing discursive strategies used in counterpublics and analyzing networks of specific movements or organizations, while the perception and experiences of group members remain largely unexplored. To fill this research gap, this study analyzes the internal negotiations surrounding the Facebook page 'Write it down! I am an Arab,' which serves as a counterpublic for Arab citizens of Israel. The study employs two methods: (1) interviews with 14 participants of the 'Write it down! I am an Arab' Facebook page, and (2) a thematic analysis of 1,529 comments made by Arab respondents on the same page. The findings reveal a complex understanding of the counter public, defined by internal contradictions among group members concerning its goals and pragmatics, and especially its orientation or position. While the page participants view it as a subversive platform and an alternative means to access the dominant public sphere, many commenters consider the act of addressing the Jewish public as subservient, perpetuating and normalizing prevailing power dynamics. These findings highlight that counterpublics are not homogeneous structures automatically granted natural legitimacy by the group members, and that the counterpublic's position or orientation is a crucial factor in the discursive negotiations taking place within the group.",20241215,"Lowenstein-Barkai, Hila",Article,Academic Journal,Dec2024,true,"Information, Communication & Society",Online social networks ; Arabs ; Palestinian citizens of Israel ; Evidence gaps ; Thematic analysis,JOUR,,,1369-118X,,,,,eng,Taylor & Francis Ltd,2759,2744,16,27,16,10.1080/1369118X.2023.2289972,,5BA,,https://research.ebsco.com/linkprocessor/plink?id=c19484a4-baf3-33b7-b7d1-8f39ff977cca

Indisputably, 3D technology-enhanced environments have provided considerable benefits and affordances to the contemporary e-Education. In these circumstances, virtual worlds (VWs) like second life (SL) have generally intensified with an extensive perpetuation and penetration of innovative performances that encapsulated or enacted from the vast majority of higher education fields. At the same time, there is growing widespread recognition of reasons affecting the high or low degree of students' engagement in online and blended course delivery methods held in 3D VWs. Notwithstanding that most notable studies have disclosed SL functional capabilities from a plethora of pilot case studies, however, it is still lacking an experiential-based research approach to determine the degree of students' engagement in blended and online courses at university level through SL. The present comparative study explores students' engagement overall as a multidimensional construct consisting of emotional, behavioral, and cognitive factors. One hundred and thirty-five undergraduate and postgraduate students in almost identical blended and online instructional conditions held in SL took part in this project. Preliminary results have decoded students' satisfaction for both methods, despite the fact that the voluntary sample composed of different educational disciplines. The quantitative analysis showed that postgraduate students of the online course had more positive results and the degree of engagement significantly increased compared to those who enrolled with the blended course delivery method. The instructional affordances from the utilization of SL were the collaborative climate between users (instructor and students) who eliminated various intractable boundaries which were predominantly observed by several conventional methods. Specifically it was revealed that the online course delivery method engaged more students with the collaborative activities.

"Library, Information Science & Technology Abstracts",lxh,24560044,Affordance theory: a framework for graduate students' information behavior.,"Purpose — This study seeks to apply ecological psychology's concept of ‘affordance’ to graduate students' information behavior in the academic library, and to explore the extent to which the affordances experienced by graduate students differed from the affordances librarians were attempting to provide. Design/methodology/approach — In-depth, qualitative interviews with graduate students and academic librarians explored how the students perceived and used the library's various ‘opportunities for action’ (e.g. books, databases, instructional sessions, librarians, physical space, etc.) and compared these perceptions and behavior with librarians' intentions and expectations. Findings — Findings indicate a disparity between expectations and experience and point to graduate students as an underserved population in this context, especially in terms of the library's outreach efforts.

We define and use four complementary types of affordance in the context of interaction design and evaluation: cognitive affordance , physical affordance , sensory affordance , and functional affordance . The terms cognitive affordance (Norman's perceived affordance) and physical affordance (Norman's real affordance) refer to parallel and equally important usability concepts for interaction design, to which sensory affordance plays a supporting role. We argue that the concept of physical affordance carries a mandatory component of utility or purposeful action (functional affordance).

In recent years, online disinformation has been implicated as a source of field-level institutional change across a variety of societal contexts. To better understand how online disinformation changes institutional issue fields, we explore how digital materiality affords users opportunities to create and propagate disinformation. We introduce and define three social media material features: modular content, content flow, and manifold network structures. From these digital materiality elements, we articulate three disinformation affordances: crafting, amplifying, and partitioning. We rely on several vignettes – far-right political conspiracy group, QAnon, anti-vaccination (i.e., anti-Vaxxers), and flat Earth beliefs – to illustrate how social media users exploit digital materiality and enact disinformation affordances. Our theoretical development also contributes to our understanding of how online disinformation disrupts institutional issue fields. In particular, we highlight several potential changes to institutional issue fields regarding power centralization, subfield structures, and institutional infrastructure. We conclude by offering recommendations for future research and social media policy. • Individuals circulate online disinformation to disrupt institutions. • Three aspects of digital materiality contribute to disinformation. • Digital materiality affords users opportunities to create and spread disinformation. • Disinformation may disrupt the routine functioning of issue fields. • Altering social media material features helps to reduce disinformation.",20231201,"Davis, Daniel J. ; Beck, Tammy E.",Article,Academic Journal,Dec2023,true,Information & Organization,Disinformation ; Social media ; Mass media policy,JOUR,,,1471-7727,,,,,eng,Elsevier B.V.,N.PAG,N.PAG,,33,4,10.1016/j.infoandorg.2023.100488,,JG1,,https://research.ebsco.com/linkprocessor/plink?id=c9bc0856-1257-3f96-a571-ed038137387c

However, social media are only useful for knowledge sharing if some people contribute knowledge that can leak from them and others retrieve knowledge that is leaking. I draw on interviews with employees from a financial services firm to develop a typology of reasons why new employees would not want to contribute what they know to a social media or retrieve from it knowledge contributed by others.

Elaborating on the data of a previous experimental study with 453 adolescents, we compared bystanders’ behavioural intentions to help the victim according to their ‘mediacy’ (via communication technologies (CT) or face-to-face) and their ‘privacy’ (in public or in private). Furthermore, we investigated whether the context of the harassing incident (incident severity, identity and behaviour of other bystanders) influenced the ‘mediacy’ and ‘privacy’ of bystanders’ helping intentions. The results showed that in general bystanders had higher behavioural intentions to help the victim in private (vs. in public) and via CT (vs. face-to-face). While incident severity influenced the ‘mediacy’ of bystanders’ helping intentions, the identity and behaviour of other bystanders affected the ‘privacy’ of their helping intentions.",20150401,"Bastiaensens, Sara ; Vandebosch, Heidi ; Poels, Karolien ; Van Cleemput, Katrien ; DeSmet, Ann ; De Bourdeaudhuij, Ilse",Journal Article,Academic Journal,Apr2015,true,Behaviour & Information Technology,,JOUR,,,0144-929X,,,,,eng,Taylor & Francis Ltd,435,425,11,34,4,10.1080/0144929X.2014.983979,,B6Q,,https://research.ebsco.com/linkprocessor/plink?id=16d18404-97a9-3690-a2f4-c89ada0897bb

"Library, Information Science & Technology Abstracts",lxh,186259175,A Framework for Participatory Creation of Digital Futures: A Longitudinal Study on Enhancing Media Literacy and Inclusion in K-12 Through Virtual Reality.,"The present study explores the affordances of virtual reality (VR) technologies to enhance digital and media literacy skills within an interdisciplinary and inclusive K-12 English as a Foreign Language (EFL) learning context. Addressing gaps in research on the design and impact of VR experiences in secondary education, the study investigates VR affordances not only as a learning tool, but also as a medium for knowledge co-creation through learning by doing, with students acting as the agents within digital social contexts. The study was conducted for two years, with 59 participants aged 13–14 years old, following a structured five-phase intervention model with the intent to comply with DigComp 2.2 guidelines for digital citizenship and the Universal Design for Learning (UDL) for inclusive educational practices. The phases involved (a) training on the technological level to leverage digital tools; (b) media and information literacy (MIL) instruction in VR; (c) collaborative VR artifact creation; (d) peer evaluation; and (e) dissemination with peers from other sociocultural contexts for an iterative process of continuous content improvement and social discourse. Mixed methods data collection included pre/post-course surveys, pre/post-tests, observation journals, and student-generated VR artifact evaluations. The findings indicate consistent learning gains across both years, with an average pre–post gain of 18 points (Cohen's d = −2.25; t = −17.3, p < 0.001). The VR-supported intervention fostered complex skillset building within a VR-supported dynamic learning environment that caters to diverse needs. Students' reflections informed a framework for designing inclusive media literacy in VR, structured around three main pillars: Narrative Structure, Strategic Design, and Representation Awareness. These themes encapsulate the practical, cognitive, and ethical dimensions of VR design. Sub-themes with examples contribute to understanding the key design elements of VR in promoting participatory engagement, digital and media literacy, critical discourse, and inclusive education. The sub-themes per pillar are signaling and multisensory cues, storyline, and artful thinking; schema formation, multimedia encoding, and optimal cognitive load; and bias-free, respect for emotional impact, and language and symbols. Complementary quantitative findings confirmed the themes of the proposed framework, revealing a positive correlation between the perceived ease of use (PEoU) with digital skills development and a negative correlation between perceived usefulness (PU) and cognitive load.

The study offers a topic-based qualitative content analysis of public posts about the most popular location tracking app Life360 across three key social media platforms—X (formerly Twitter), YouTube and TikTok. It adopts a cross-platform perspective to gather and analyse varied viewpoints from these platforms, which differ in their social media content, user demographics, and technical affordances. The analysis reveals an extensive range of public discussion topics, which are categorised into three themes: Family Experiences, Views and Values; News, Commerce and Information; and Critique, Subversion, and Humour. The themes align with the different platform vernaculars of each platform, with X posts spread across family experience, news and criticial commentary, whilst YouTube emphasises more commercial and informational topics, and TikTok surfaces more humour, subversive or critical posts, especially from younger users. Furthermore, the cross-platform analysis highlights how the personal, political, and subversive posts from teenage users on TikTok influences the wider news and public discussions about family location tracking and surveillance across other social and legacy media.",20250901,"Nansen, Bjørn ; Mavoa, Jane ; Coghlan, Simon ; Gibbs, Martin",Article,Academic Journal,Sep2025,true,New Review of Hypermedia & Multimedia,Teenagers ; Location-based services ; Cell phone tracking ; Transmedia storytelling ; Discourse analysis ; Thematic analysis ; Electronic surveillance ; Public opinion,JOUR,,,1361-4568,,,,,eng,Taylor & Francis Ltd,249,229,21,31,3,10.1080/13614568.2024.2437399,,RQN,,https://research.ebsco.com/linkprocessor/plink?id=288533a2-d426-3d8e-ba84-79126f82c9b5

Based on a design-based research (DBR) methodology, this study investigates the effects of tangible tools (e.g., base-ten blocks, fraction circles) and digital applications (e.g., GeoGebra Classic 6, Polypad) on preservice teachers' problem solving, conceptual understanding, engagement, and instructional reasoning. Data were collected through surveys (n = 53), semi-structured interviews (n = 25), and classroom observations (n = 30) in a Spanish university's teacher education program. Key findings show that both forms of manipulatives significantly enhance engagement and conceptual clarity, but are affected by logistical and digital access barriers. This paper further proposes a theoretically grounded model for simulating manipulatives through ICT-based environments, enabling scalable and adaptive mathematics teacher training. By linking constructivist learning theory, the Technologically Enhanced Learning Environment (TELE) framework, and simulation-based pedagogy, this model aims to replicate the cognitive, affective, and collaborative affordances of manipulatives in virtual contexts. Distinct from prior work, this study contributes an integrated theoretical and practical framework, contextualized through empirical classroom data, and presents a clear plan for real-world ICT-based implementation.

Previous theories of work-life boundary management frame boundary management strategies as a range between the segmentation and integration of work-life domains, but fail to provide a satisfactory account of technology's role. Design/methodology/approach -- The authors apply the concept of affordances, defined as the relationship between users' abilities and features of mobile technology, in two field studies of a total of 25 mobile workers who used a variety of mobile devices and services. Findings -- The results demonstrate that the material features of mobile technologies offer five specific affordances that mobile workers use in managing work-life boundaries: mobility, connectedness, interoperability, identifiability and personalization. These affordances persist in their influence across time, despite their connection to different technology features. Originality/value -- The author found that mobile workers' boundary management strategies do not fit comfortably along a linear segmentation-integration continuum. Rather, mobile workers establish a variety of personalized boundary management practices to match their particular situations. The authors speculate that mobile technology has core material properties that endure over time. The authors surmise that these material properties provide opportunities for users to interact with them in a manner to make the five affordances possible. Therefore, in the future, actors interacting with mobile devices to manage their work-life boundaries may experience affordances similar to those the authors observed because of the presence of the core material properties.",20150201,"Cousins, Karlene ; Robey, Daniel",Article,Academic Journal,2015,true,Information Technology & People,Technological innovations ; Cell phones ; Work-life balance ; Labor supply ; Bring your own device policies,JOUR,,,0959-3845,,,,,eng,Emerald Publishing Limited,71,34,38,28,1,10.1108/ITP-08-2013-0155,,67S,,https://research.ebsco.com/linkprocessor/plink?id=86ae0911-3b73-3840-bd60-bfe307685cf4

However, migrants’ engagement with politics in their home country has become increasingly virtual with the advent of mobile/social media, suggesting a need to go beyond traditional theorizations. This article tries to understand how affordances of new media are leveraged by migrants with different political orientations as they engaged politically with their homeland. Two contexts were identified to understand their transnational political exchanges: (a) elections in homeland India, and (b) the backdrop of various civil society movements. In-depth interviews were conducted among 31 Indian migrants in Singapore with diverse political ideologies and linguistic backgrounds. Calling, messaging, sharing of news stories/posts, and commenting were the most commonly used mobile affordances. Social constructivist tradition in technology appropriation found support in the way respondents tested the affordances of mobile/social media before adding them to their usage repertoire.

Findings -- First, the reviewed literature indicates that the navigational features of the DAISY talking book appear to provide unprecedented affordances in terms of the users' approaches to reading. However, the affordances of talking books depend, to some extent, on whether the users have visual impairments or dyslexia/reading and writing difficulties. Second, the reviewed literature illustrates that the affordances provided by talking books depend on the settings in which they are used, both in terms of specific social situations and wider socio-political contexts. Originality/value -- Although the need for assistive reading technologies, such as digital talking books, is large, research in this area is scarce, particularly from a user perspective. This paper describes the results of those studies which have actually been conducted on this topic and highlights areas that require further study.",20150101,"Lundh, Anna Hampson ; Johnson, Genevieve Marie",Article,Academic Journal,2015,true,Library Hi Tech,Talking books ; Electronic books ; Reading interests of blind people ; Reading interests of people with visual disabilities ; Empirical research,JOUR,,,0737-8831,,,,,eng,Emerald Publishing Limited,64,54,11,33,1,10.1108/LHT-07-2014-0074,,LHT,,https://research.ebsco.com/linkprocessor/plink?id=4337e346-0b4a-3628-a6ff-05232101ce54
"Library, Information Science & Technology Abstracts",lxh,100746843,Effects of extrinsic and intrinsic motivation on participation in crowdsourcing contest.,"Purpose -- The rapid development of Web 2.0 and social media enables the rise of crowdsourcing. Crowdsourcing contest is a typical case of crowdsourcing and has been adopted by many organisations for business solution and decision making. From a participant's perspective, it is interesting to explore what motivates people to participate in crowdsourcing contest. The purpose of this paper is to investigate the category of motivation based on self-determination theory and synthesises various motivation factors in crowdsourcing contest. Meanwhile, perceived motivational affordances and task granularity are also examined as the moderate constructs. Design/methodology/approach -- The paper builds a conceptual model to illustrate the relationships between various motivations (extrinsic and intrinsic) and participation effort under the moderating of perceived motivational affordances and task granularity. An empirical study is conducted to test the research model by surveying the Chinese participants of crowdsourcing contest. Findings -- The results show that various motivations might play different roles in relating to participation effort expended in the crowdsourcing contest. Moreover, task granularity may positively moderate the relationship between external motivation and participation effort. The results also show that supporting of a participant's perceived motivational affordances might strengthen the relationship between the individual's motivation with an internal focus (intrinsic, integrated, identified and introjected motivation) and participation effort. Originality/value -- Overall, the research has some conceptual and theoretical implications to the literature. This study synthesises various motivation factors identified by previous studies in crowdsourcing projects or communities as a form of motivation spectrum, namely external, introjected, identified, integrated and intrinsic motivation, which contributes to the motivation literatures. Meanwhile, the findings indicate that various motivations might play different roles in relating to participation effort expended in the crowdsourcing contest. Also, the study theoretically extends the crowdsourcing participation research to incorporate the effects of perceived motivational affordances in crowdsourcing contest. In addition, the study may yield some practical implications for sponsors, managers and designers in crowdsourcing contest.",20141201,"Zhao, Yuxiang Chris ; Zhu, Qinghua",Article,Academic Journal,2014,true,Online Information Review,Crowdsourcing ; Extrinsic motivation ; Intrinsic motivation ; Autonomy (Psychology) ; Participation ; Decision making in business ; Contests,JOUR,,,1468-4527,,,,,eng,Emerald Publishing Limited,917,896,22,38,1,10.1108/OIR-08-2014-0188,,9NA,,https://research.ebsco.com/linkprocessor/plink?id=0c3d4355-387a-34ec-b4e6-7b84a188a6e0
"Library, Information Science & Technology Abstracts",lxh,160461244,Pathways to developing information technology-enabled capabilities in born-digital new ventures.,"Despite significant business opportunities made possible through advancements in technology, readily available digital technologies are often overlooked and not used by new ventures. To address this knowledge gap, this paper looks at the relationships between readily available digital technologies and born-digital new venture capabilities. We use an affordance lens to explore conditions in which born-digital new ventures interact with digital technologies to actualize digital affordances that facilitate the development of important capabilities. First, using the existing literature, we present a research model and its key elements. Then, using data on new ventures in a Canadian university incubator, we conduct fuzzy-set qualitative comparative analysis (fsQCA) and develop seven configurational research propositions as pathways to develop information technology-enabled organizational capabilities in new ventures. Using this retroductive approach, this research builds a context-specific middle-range theory that explains complex interactions between readily available digital technologies and new venture characteristics, where resources are provided by incubators in dynamic environments, to facilitate the development of ITOCs in the new ventures. We close by describing the study's theoretical and practical implications. • Explaining how new ventures develop IT-enabled organizational capabilities. • Developing a context-specific middle-range theory using retroduction and fsQCA. • Highlighting the importance of technology affordances in entrepreneurial ecosystems. • Examining the role of digital technology in academic entrepreneurship settings. • Guiding policy on strategic IT investments in entrepreneurial ecosystems.",20230201,"Sadreddin, Arman ; Chan, Yolande E.",Article,Academic Journal,Feb2023,true,International Journal of Information Management,Digital technology ; Technological innovations ; New business enterprises ; Investment policy ; Entrepreneurship,JOUR,,,0268-4012,,,,,eng,Elsevier B.V.,N.PAG,N.PAG,,68,,10.1016/j.ijinfomgt.2022.102572,,1LL,,https://research.ebsco.com/linkprocessor/plink?id=b5d9d297-8bd5-38e1-87c7-c04ba4012cd4
"Library, Information Science & Technology Abstracts",lxh,160461239,Facilitating interorganizational trust in strategic alliances by leveraging blockchain-based systems: Case studies of two eastern banks.,"Strategic alliances require mutual trust and collaboration between organizations. To increase alliance performance, organizations in a strategic alliance are more likely to interpret each other's equivocal behaviors in a positive way to sustain the stability of the relationship. Different from traditional mechanisms to build interorganizational trust, blockchain facilitates trust among alliance partners via its technology advantages, for example, public ledger and distributed consensus. The decentralized and distributed nature of a blockchain-based system assures that no single organization can add information to the chain without an approval from the alliance, nor can it make unilateral changes in the system. Drawing from the Affordance Theory, we propose an exploratory research design to understand the structure of a blockchain-based system, as well as how this blockchain-based system influences interorganizational trust in a strategic alliance and how blockchain-enabled interorganizational trust influences alliance performance. The case studies of two eastern banks indicate that the technical features of blockchain can help reduce equivocal behaviors and improve interorganizational trust. We discuss the findings and conclude the paper with implications. • Two cases about blockchain-based ABS systems. • Revealing managerial implications of the blockchain technology from an IS perspective. • Technical properties of blockchain enables data affordance and process affordance. • Data and process affordances support the improvement of interorganizational trust.",20230201,"Chen, Renee Rui ; Chen, Kun ; Ou, Carol X.J.",Article,Academic Journal,Feb2023,true,International Journal of Information Management,Electronic data processing ; Experimental design ; Trust ; Blockchains,JOUR,,,0268-4012,,,,,eng,Elsevier B.V.,N.PAG,N.PAG,,68,,10.1016/j.ijinfomgt.2022.102521,,1LL,,https://research.ebsco.com/linkprocessor/plink?id=4bc8941b-51ba-38ca-881b-4a9a9794b68a

We present findings from an interpretive, longitudinal case study at the emergency general surgery ward of a Nordic university hospital. By focusing our analysis on how sociomaterial affordances emerge through the implementation, use and continued development of digital and physical visualization boards, we show how these artifacts constitute an integral part of the operational staff's sensemaking and enactment of a new institutional logic. We make two contributions. First, we show how the perceived affordances of a technology are created from the experience of using several different technologies and how the rejection of one technology can simultaneously constitute another.

We expand on Norman, Hartson and Best's categories of affordances by proposing an additional four tiered framework for the categorization of types of communication breakdowns that occur in human–computer interactions. The four proposed categories are: human–computer; computer–network; human–network; and finally, technologically mediated human–human. This proposed mode of categorizing the data allows for a greater depth of analysis into the causes of complex communication errors, and participants' reactions to these disruptions in relation to their experiences of control. Each of the four categories is assessed according to the types of affordances indicated in the technological issues and whether they were reported as positive or negative by the participants of the study. The information is then analyzed according to the categories of users' attitudes toward technology (2007). The final level of communication error, that between human participants in technologically mediated conversation, leads to the positing of three categories of users: audio communicators; textual communicators; and flexible communicators.

This study examines how the Learning Management System (LMS) affords people the ability to take actions in an online course. A model is proposed to explain the effect of LMS affordances on the Community of Inquiry and on course satisfaction, and propose and test several hypotheses about their relationships. A pilot study found that while two common Learning Management Systems had different tools, faculty varied widely in their use and perception of the affordances of the tools. In the subsequent quantitative study, surveys were administered to 605 online students in a large Midwestern university.

"Library, Information Science & Technology Abstracts",lxh,51981583,Cultivating Interaction Ubiquity at Work.,"There is limited debate on what “ubiquity” in ubiquitous computing implies, in particular in regard to technological affordances connecting people. The aim of this article is to explore the question: What is the role of technologically embedded assumptions in the cultivation of interaction ubiquity at work? Distinguishing between the embedded support for managing ongoing interaction relationships—as opposed to a series of interaction encounters—and the support for prioritizing interactions—as opposed to priorities per se—yields four analytical categories of affordances: connectors, filters, mediators, and coordinators. These four categories are illustrated through four case studies of mobile working. The author argues that successful cultivation of interaction ubiquity at work relies critically on a portfolio approach wherein the technology is seen as playing a more active role in the management of interaction beyond the simple standardized technical connection.",20100701,"Sørensen, Carsten",Article,Academic Journal,Jul/Aug2010,true,Information Society,Ubiquitous computing ; Distributed computing ; Human-computer interaction ; Technological innovations ; Digital electric filters ; Embedded computer systems ; Arbitrators ; Technology ; Digital electronics,JOUR,,,0197-2243,,,,,eng,Taylor & Francis Ltd,287,276,12,26,4,10.1080/01972243.2010.489856,,1HQ,,https://research.ebsco.com/linkprocessor/plink?id=02986a94-d452-34eb-86b4-1b1633c60129
"Library, Information Science & Technology Abstracts",lxh,52818937,Team Learning in Technology-Mediated Distributed Teams.,"This study examines technological, educational/learning, and social affordances associated with the facilitation of project-based learning and problem solving in technology-mediated distributed teams. An empirical interpretive research approach using direct observation is used to interpret, evaluate and rate observable manifested behaviors and qualitative content (i.e. discussions) associated with project-based team learning. The theory of affordances and social impact theory are integrated to develop a conceptual model that asserts that collaboration mode (collocated vs. non-collocated and videoconferencing supported) will dictate the quality of information exchange, progressive elaboration of ideas, and the social processes that influence team learning. Team learning is then suggested to yield better productivity and higher perceived interaction quality. Results showed that collaboration mode can impact team information exchange and interpretation and ultimately task outcomes. Further, collaboration mode can also create a social structure that influences the capacity for a team to maintain a mutual supportive and positive climate needed for successful project-based task outcomes. The results offer some extended insights into the technology-mediated collaborative learning process among students in a higher education context as well as in organizational settings.

"Library, Information Science & Technology Abstracts",lxh,160369835,Role of brand engagement and co-creation experience in online brand community continuance: A service-dominant logic perspective.,"• Value experiences contribute to online brand community (OBC) continuance intention. • Brand engagement and co-creation experience captures value experience in OBCs. • Social media affordances and OBC identification facilitate resource integration. • Social media affordances and OBC identification enact members' value experiences. Value creation and acquisition are pivotal for continuous participation in online communities and thus have become goals that brand companies strive to develop in online brand communities (OBCs). Prior studies, however, predominately adopted the goods-dominant logic to assess the role of OBC members' value perceptions in their value experiences. Such an approach overlooks the fact that one's value experiences in OBCs manifest in the co-creation with the brand and with other OBC members, benefiting from technology platforms and one's community motives. We thus draw on the service-dominant logic to formulate a research model with seven research hypotheses. These hypotheses depict relationships among five research constructs, in which (1) OBC continuance intention serves as the ultimate dependent variable, (2) brand engagement and co-creation experience represent OBC members' value experiences in consumer-to-brand and consumer-to-consumer interactions, respectively, and (3) social media affordances and members' OBC identification serve as the antecedents of OBC members' value experiences. We used the Amazon MTurk platform to collect 246 valid samples worldwide that represent general OBC members. We adopted PLS-SEM to assess the measurement model and test the proposed hypotheses. Our findings indicate that co-creation experience and brand engagement are pivotal value experiences that can increase OBC continuance intention. In addition, social media affordances and OBC identification are instrumental to both value experiences through their facilitation of technology-mediated and communal interactions for resource integration and service exchange among OBC members and the brand. This study sheds light on OBC research by identifying the central role of brand engagement and co-creation experience in OBC continuance.

"Library, Information Science & Technology Abstracts",lxh,164489856,Examining the relationship between sociomaterial practices enacted in the organizational use of social media and the emerging role of organizational generativity.,"The growth of social media has enabled new operating methods and sparked organizational optimism in social technologies. We must broadly and distinctively identify the practices enacted in the organizational use of social technologies, understand how these practices influence each other, and the mechanisms driving their achievement. This paper deduces the sociomaterial practices enacted in the organizational use of social media and the augmenting generative capabilities. We surveyed seventy-three (73) organizations, collected 267 usable responses and applied structural equation modelling (SEM) techniques to analyze the data. The paper offers two contributions. First, we utilize the affordances-in-practice perspective to identify and categorize organizational practices enacted on social media, including functional, symbolic, and interactive practices. Then, we highlight the role of organizational generativity in facilitating these practices. Generativity represents the ability to revitalize, procreate, and introduce new ways of acting in dynamic or transient situations. Overall, our findings show how social media practices relate to organizational generativity and the mediating role of symbolic-driven practices. • Organizational practices on social media can be functional, symbolic, or interactive. • Organizational generativity augments social media practices. • Symbolic practices influence the functional and interactive practices. • Symbolic practices mediate the relationship between generativity and other practices.",20230801,"Namisango, Fatuma ; Kang, Kyeong ; Rehman, Junaid",Article,Academic Journal,Aug2023,true,International Journal of Information Management,Social media ; Cultural transmission ; Structural equation modeling,JOUR,,,0268-4012,,,,,eng,Elsevier B.V.,N.PAG,N.PAG,,71,,10.1016/j.ijinfomgt.2023.102643,,1LL,,https://research.ebsco.com/linkprocessor/plink?id=a99f3b25-fba2-341d-8b5f-a95838ad3bb9
"Library, Information Science & Technology Abstracts",lxh,44812916,INVALID COMMAND.,"Recent studies of information and communication technologies as diverse as mobile phones, video games and computers have revealed the centrality of control issues to users. But although researchers have highlighted the centrality of control as a concept in understanding user experiences of digital technology, studies have not sufficiently prioritized the experience. Findings about control have been mostly tangential. We contend that a salient and central feature of our use of digital technologies is our experience of control, and a more robust understanding of this experience - and whether it is misplaced - is urgently necessary in our contemporary, highly networked society. In answer to this need, we have undertaken a qualitative study into user experiences of control. Our starting conjecture is that the more competent a technology's functional and perceived affordances, the greater the experience of user control. We draw on Rex Hartson's schema of technological affordances, which refer to the way in which technologies allow us to accomplish things in the world. Our findings indicate that Hartson's schema is useful as a starting point for categorizing different experiences of control, but needs to be modified and expanded. In addition to these two types of affordance, findings also indicate that users experience control issues in relation to what we term maintenance affordances, or the need to keep the technology going, and contextual affordances, or the abilities granted by the context of use.",20091001,"Best, Kirsty",Article,Academic Journal,Oct2009,true,"Information, Communication & Society",Mobile communication systems ; Communication & technology ; Computer graphics ; Video games,JOUR,,,1369-118X,,,,,eng,Taylor & Francis Ltd,1040,1015,26,12,7,10.1080/13691180802471463,,5BA,,https://research.ebsco.com/linkprocessor/plink?id=b83f728d-afc9-3ea4-b8a3-e311b6c2e052

Through a conceptualization of the affordances of social media that considers what they enable alongside what they constrain, it uses a computational grounded theory approach to examine individuals' posts and the use of hashtags in online communication on Sina Weibo around the #DrivingIntoThePalaceMuseum case. Through its analysis, three discursive logics of online populism are identified: antagonistic logic, polarization logic and protest logic. However, while the affordances of social media enable populist discourse polarization, they also enable ""depolarization"" through the government's censorship mechanisms. This results in a dynamic bottom-up populism articulation that reflects an awareness of China's censorship mechanisms.

While prior research has mostly examined the design and architecture of digital platforms, less attention has been given to digital platform boundary resources as an entrepreneurship strategy. The boundary resources of a digital platform significantly impact third‐party developers' motivation to engage in digital entrepreneurship. Consequently, scholars need to carefully investigate the affordances of the boundary resources that influence third‐party developers to create complementary applications as products for entrepreneurial endeavors. To address this gap, the researcher formulated two research questions and conducted an inductive case study to explore the perspectives and views of third‐party application developers in technology hubs within Nigeria's digital start‐up ecosystem. Nigeria has a large youth population with a strong digital potential (i.e., tech‐savvy) and is confronted with uncertainties, limited resources, and complexities.

"Library, Information Science & Technology Abstracts",lxh,185991963,Examining generative AI user disclosure intention: an ELM perspective.,"Generative AI needs to collect massive information including personal information to train the model and improve the accuracy of answers. This may incur privacy risks and reduce user disclosure intention. Based on the elaboration likelihood model (ELM), this research explored generative AI user disclosure intention. The results revealed that disclosure intention receives a dual influence from both central factors (perceived anthropomorphism, perceived accuracy and perceived affordance) and peripheral factors (privacy statement, social influence and privacy risk). Algorithm literacy acts as a significant moderation variable of this dual-path model. The fsQCA identified three configurations leading to disclosure intention. These results imply that generative AI platforms need to improve content quality and reduce privacy risk in order to promote user disclosure intention.",20250601,"Zhou, Tao ; Wu, Xiaoying",Article,Academic Journal,Jun2025,true,Universal Access in the Information Society,Disclosure ; Generative artificial intelligence ; Elaboration likelihood model ; Social influence ; Personal training,JOUR,,,1615-5289,,,,,eng,Springer Nature,1220,1209,12,24,2,10.1007/s10209-024-01130-1,,O75,,https://research.ebsco.com/linkprocessor/plink?id=a79c22c8-a7c8-33e4-87b4-cabbc508004f

Including their children in their content may make them more authentic and increase their celebrity capital. However, empirical research testing this assumption is scarce. Importantly, the portrayal of children in influencer sharenting has raised concern regarding the privacy of the portrayed child and the related consequences for the child's well-being. Through 20 in-depth interviews with followers of momfluencers, we assessed the perceptions of and attitudes towards child portrayal in momfluencer content and privacy-protective behaviors. The mothers in our study appeared to be highly concerned about the risks related to sharenting behaviors. While these mothers believed that portraying children in momfluencer content is essential to enhance their perceptions of credibility, authenticity, and intimacy; they emphasized that this can be achieved while protecting the child's privacy through the use of anti-sharenting techniques. Transparent communication about the choices momfluencers make regarding these techniques appeared to be essential for fostering meaningful relationships. In addition, momfluencers who employ anti-sharenting techniques and transparently explain their reasons for doing so may have the potential to influence changes in followers' own sharenting behavior. These findings emphasize the potential of anonymizing children in momfluencer content, enabling momfluencers to protect their children's online privacy while maintaining the affordances of sharenting.",20250601,"Van den Abeele, Elisabeth ; Hudders, Liselot ; Vanwesenbeeck, Ini",Article,Academic Journal,Jun2025,true,"Information, Communication & Society",Privacy ; Social media ; Parenting ; Primary audience ; Sincerity ; Parental influences,JOUR,,,1369-118X,,,,,eng,Taylor & Francis Ltd,1307,1287,21,28,7,10.1080/1369118X.2024.2352625,,5BA,,https://research.ebsco.com/linkprocessor/plink?id=a87ed1e6-704a-36b7-a877-d421553132f8

This study emphasizes gaming and gambling opportunities related to NFTs and blockchain technology which suggest shifts towards increased risk-taking and a blurring of financial and entertainment contexts. In ZED Run, users' interactions with designed systems, as well as interest in improving one's understanding of the application and its associated marketplace, is motivated by interest in financial reward. This work argues this close relationship of financial interests to gaming and gambling environments risks fostering an increasingly gamified approach to financial life.

However, there is still a lack of research on how podcasting can be used as a tool for education and personal development. The current study, framed in Jenkins' participatory culture where artistic expression and civic engagement are valued, aimed to fill this gap in research. Ten Taiwanese undergraduate English majors were invited to take the role of podcasters to create their original podcast programs and upload them to popular podcast platforms. A podcaster diary was also kept by each participant to document his/her experience as a podcaster. It was found that the participants generally enjoyed the experience of creating their first podcast programs. Their various podcast topics largely reflected their current lifestyles and interests. Multiple learning opportunities were afforded by this experience as the participants learned to use their voices to share their lives and display their knowledge. These results highlighted the potential of podcasting as a tool for personal and professional growth in the digital age. It is hoped that these results will offer important insights on how to help students open up windows of opportunities for personal learning and career enhancement.",20241001,"Chen, Cheryl Wei-Yu",Article,Academic Journal,Oct-Dec2024,true,Computers in the Schools,Digital technology ; Career development ; Podcasting ; Participatory culture ; Evidence gaps,JOUR,,,0738-0569,,,,,eng,Taylor & Francis Ltd,515,497,19,41,4,10.1080/07380569.2023.2291639,,CIT,,https://research.ebsco.com/linkprocessor/plink?id=2dc96e2b-5cbd-33c6-bb51-d01d83a5f0b5
"Library, Information Science & Technology Abstracts",lxh,108680469,Enacting technology.,"Purpose – The purpose of this paper is to discuss implications of human-technology interaction in organizational change, especially where mobile phones are introduced to replace paper-based reporting. Design/methodology/approach – The paper employs a case study approach, focusing on implementation of mobile technology for health (mHealth) solutions to support remote data communication, between health facilities and a district health office (DHO), in Malawi. Findings – The findings suggest that mobile phones are relevant to parts of multi-stage tasks such as data reporting, which comprise compilation, transportation, and digitization of data, and delivery of feedback. Consequently, innovation due to the introduction of mobile phones, is found in their interaction with other artefacts (paper, desktop computers, etc.), and existing paper-centric and emerging work practices. Research limitations/implications – Although lessons from this study could be transported across contexts, practitioners, and researchers should pay particular attention to contextual differences. Practical implications – In accounting for the mutual shaping between technology and context/work practices the paper demonstrates that mHealth innovation demands significant practical work. Originality/value – mHealth research is often preoccupied with capabilities of mobile devices. First, the authors account for interaction between artefacts, existing, and emerging use contexts, and the use process, at multiple levels of organization. Through this, the authors argue for a need to seriously consider idiosyncrasies of artefacts and tasks at hand, as well as distributed affordances across artefacts, in mHealth implementations. Second, the authors argue that contrary to the general focus on mobile phones as tools for supporting people on the move, their relevance might actually be found in reducing people’s mobility.",20150701,"Manda, Tiwonge Davis ; Herstad, Jo",Article,Academic Journal,2015,true,Information Technology & People,Mobile communication systems ; Cell phones ; Mobile health ; Human body & technology,JOUR,,,0959-3845,,,,,eng,Emerald Publishing Limited,465,442,24,28,3,10.1108/ITP-02-2014-0045,,67S,,https://research.ebsco.com/linkprocessor/plink?id=3701b78e-e2ad-3198-8a9f-d7338f2aef51

"Library, Information Science & Technology Abstracts",lxh,157253546,The digital is different: Emergence and relationality in critical realist research.,"When analyzing empirical phenomena, the implicit or explicit assumptions we have of relationality guide what we take as the primary units of analysis and how we study them. This paper investigates and expands on the notion of relationality and relational explanations in the Critical Realist (CR) paradigm of Information Systems (IS) research. As digital technologies are becoming increasingly adaptive to the social and socio-technical structures they are embedded in, it is necessary to expand the field's conceptual tools in its study of digital phenomena. Therefore, to explain why the digital seems more tightly coupled to social phenomena than other types of technologies, the concept of transformational emergence is introduced. The key argument is that the malleability of digital entities entails that they are disposed to transform by emergence, which is key to understanding the constitutive relationality between the social and the technical in contemporary digital phenomena. This has fundamental implications for CR-based theories in the IS field, most notably Affordance theory and Representation theory. • Engages with the critical realist understanding of relationality and emergence in information systems research. • Highlights how constitutive relationality can be understood in critical realist terms. • Introduces the concept of transformational emergence to theorize digital phenomena. • Discusses the implications transformational emergence have for affordance theory and representation theory.",20220601,"Kempton, Alexander Moltubakk",Article,Academic Journal,Jun2022,true,Information & Organization,,JOUR,,,1471-7727,,,,,eng,Elsevier B.V.,N.PAG,N.PAG,,32,2,10.1016/j.infoandorg.2022.100408,,JG1,,https://research.ebsco.com/linkprocessor/plink?id=be5a6d70-9228-3b51-ae2b-5f13d5efe21e
"Library, Information Science & Technology Abstracts",lxh,155491080,Legitimating digital technologies in industry exchange fields: The case of digital signatures.,"Emergent digital technologies need to be legitimated for them to enable new marketplaces to diffuse and scale. The extant literature has emphasized the role of discourse in framing legitimation efforts. Despite recognizing the broader role of technology in the legitimation process, these studies have not examined the specific affordances of digital technologies used by field members and also how this relates to the institutional infrastructure of the field to influence the legitimation process. In our study of an industry exchange field, we drew on archival data between 1997 and 2001 to examine how members of the then emergent e-commerce industry exchange field achieved legitimation of digital signatures in electronic transactions through legislation. Our research contributes to extant research by showing how the legitimation process involves invoking and scaling affordances through sensegiving, translating, and decoupling mechanisms. We also show how affordances are conditioned by the specific institutional infrastructure that supports and enables them, and how issue fields can arise within exchange fields as spaces to (re)negotiate and shape institutional changes. We conclude with implications for further research into the diffusion and scale of digital marketplaces that is of increasing importance in light of recent regulatory debates. • The study examines how digital technologies are legitimated in industry exchange fields. • The disruptive nature of digital technology gives rise to an issue field within an existing industry exchange field. • The legitimation of digital technology involves invoking and scaling of its affordances through scaling mechanisms. • The affordances of digital technology are conditioned by the institutional infrastructure that enables them. • The study has important implications for understanding how digital marketplaces diffuse and scale.",20220301,"Dahabiyeh, Laila ; Constantinides, Panos",Article,Academic Journal,Mar2022,true,Information & Organization,Digital technology ; Digital signatures ; Marketplaces,JOUR,,,1471-7727,,,,,eng,Elsevier B.V.,N.PAG,N.PAG,,32,1,10.1016/j.infoandorg.2022.100392,,JG1,,https://research.ebsco.com/linkprocessor/plink?id=1dcc63be-da56-3163-9583-f4f9138f66dd

An Annual Review of Information Science and Technology (ARIST) paper.,"As survivors have complex and varied motivations for disclosing sexual assault, information and communication technologies (ICTs) can offer unique affordances that either facilitate or hinder sexual assault disclosures. In response, this systematic review draws connections between the functions of sexual assault disclosures and how ICT design choices can impact the sexual assault disclosure process. Findings from 23 empirical studies indicate that platform affordances can facilitate sexual assault survivors' motivations of visibility, naming sexual assault experiences, anonymity, and destigmatizing sexual assault. Further, findings categorize ICT‐based sexual assault disclosure within three frames: disclosure as a linguistic act, disclosure as a reciprocal act, and disclosure as a cultural response.

While we have learned much about the structure and use of popular social media platforms, we have more to learn about less mainstream platforms, and about the ways their usage helps actors amass and wield media power. Accordingly, this paper examines networked political actors' use of alternative media to generate capital and facilitate the spread of problematic information. Drawing data from two years of research on the pro-Trump internet forum The_Donald following its ban from Reddit, the analysis considers how users develop, debate, and deploy media-related practices, and what role those practices play in shaping the broader political culture in which they exist. In addition to gleaning insights from sustained participant-observation in the forums, a content analysis of activist meta-discourse examines the technological structure and affordances of The_Donald as well as the most salient themes and broader discursive patterns, focusing specifically on those aspects of the forum that pertain to practices of manipulation and expressions of media power.

It does this by considering the infrastructural tools and governance practices at the heart of KONG Land, an example of a blockchain-based decentralised autonomous organisation (DAO) and decentralised physical infrastructure network (DePIN) project. KONG Land manufactures open-source microchips to create verifiable hardware that anyone can use or integrate into their own application. KONG Land's focus on the materiality of infrastructure led them to pursue a governance model as a digital-physical, politically decentralised polity. By foregrounding the physicality and affordances of decentralised efforts to manufacture microchips, this paper shows how rematerialising digital domains leads back to questions of statehood and its purpose and provides an explanation for emerging sovereignties.

The results based on an online survey (N = 304) reveal that context culture orientation moderated the relationship between user perceptions and behavioral intentions pertaining to a new chatbot, 'Gov.sg.'. Specifically, social aspects of a chatbot (i.e., social presence) were found to have a greater behavioral impact for those who have high-context culture orientation who prefer relational and contextual communication. On the other hand, utility aspects of a chatbot (i.e., performance expectancy) have a greater impact on individuals with low-context culture orientation who prefer explicit, task-oriented communication. The findings suggest context culture orientation is a crucial human factor determining individuals' expectations for different affordances (e.g., rich, human-like conversations vs. performance and efficiency) of chatbots.",20250301,"Haoyue, Luna Luan ; Cho, Hichang",Article,Academic Journal,Mar2025,true,Universal Access in the Information Society,Internet surveys ; Cognitive psychology ; Intention ; Expectation (Philosophy) ; Chatbots ; Culture,JOUR,,,1615-5289,,,,,eng,Springer Nature,620,607,14,24,1,10.1007/s10209-023-01087-7,,O75,,https://research.ebsco.com/linkprocessor/plink?id=a8c65b9a-92e2-34c9-91a4-21c1e77a0b05
"Library, Information Science & Technology Abstracts",lxh,183595308,The role of interface configuration on performance accuracy in eyes-free touchscreen interaction.,"This paper describes the exploration of a new category of a touchscreen interface. An eyes-free interface harnesses innate human abilities and product affordances to allow reduced levels of visual attention. Interface design for eyes-free interaction with a featureless screen is highly challenging; however, it can be achieved by simplifying and optimizing menu layout patterns to take advantage of innate human abilities including proprioception and spatial memory. This opens up a range of possibilities for peripheral device control under one-handed thumb mobile interaction. To this end, two experiments with different modes of presentation were conducted to understand the effect of interface configurations on performance accuracy caused by spatial memory and proprioception. Spatial performance results from the interaction effect of both cognitive abilities on an eyes-free interface. Vertical, horizontal, diagonal, and curved layouts with different spacing patterns have been tested in both tap and draw input modes. The results revealed that evenly spaced button alignment close to the reference frame with symmetrical patterns within a square interface area and a comfortable thumb range positively affect accuracy. The conclusions describe how alignment patterns and the mode of presentation affect visual perception and spatial integration, and a framework for the development of an eyes-free interface is set out.",20250301,"Pooripanyakun, Munyaporn ; Wodehouse, Andrew ; Mehnen, Jorn",Article,Academic Journal,Mar2025,true,Universal Access in the Information Society,Cognitive psychology ; Space perception ; Visual perception ; Spatial memory ; Proprioception ; Eye tracking,JOUR,,,1615-5289,,,,,eng,Springer Nature,408,393,16,24,1,10.1007/s10209-023-01057-z,,O75,,https://research.ebsco.com/linkprocessor/plink?id=122ce710-a889-3a36-8895-5fcbfc14d8b9

Game comics, comic games, and user agency.","This contribution examines game-like digital comics, departing from Daniel Merlin Goodbrey's concept of ""game comics"" that he discusses in his doctoral dissertation and in following articles (2017, 2020). Game comics, as the name suggests, would be interactive, playful comics, closely related to video games. In Goodbrey's words, they are ""a type of hypercomic that presents some of the key features of a game and uses some of the key features of the comic form as the basis for its gameplay"" (2020, p. 45, ""Game comics: Theory and design""). Firstly, the article defines comics, establishing a new taxonomy of digital comics (distinguishing between ""homothetic,"" ""linked,"" and ""expanded"") and positioning game comics as belonging to digital ones, yet as much more fluid objects than Goodbrey's. Secondly, it reframes the concept of interactivity within a novel framework, envisioning four types of user agency (narrative, interpretive, material, and social) that a semiotic text encourages or hinders. Lastly, it discusses a selection of game comics and reconsiders the relation the concept bears to that ofcomic games (Backe, 2020, ""Game-comics and comic-games"") – video games remediating comics' affordances, seen as game comics' hypothetical reverse. In interrogating the specifics of these objects and reflecting on the different types of user agency they prompt, the article concludes that the space between comics and games is fuzzier than taxonomies considering media in isolation would suggest.",20250301,"Busi Rizzi, Giorgio",Article,Academic Journal,Mar-Jun2025,true,New Review of Hypermedia & Multimedia,"Comic books, strips, etc. ; Comedians ; Video games ; Academic dissertations ; Game theory",JOUR,,,1361-4568,,,,,eng,Taylor & Francis Ltd,145,126,20,31,1/2,10.1080/13614568.2024.2407607,,RQN,,https://research.ebsco.com/linkprocessor/plink?id=9b67ea5e-677c-3f90-9caf-c3fa752c804b
"Library, Information Science & Technology Abstracts",lxh,183936314,Abolish privacy.,"This is a manifesto to reject calls to ""online privacy."" Privacy is an inherently exclusionary liberal entitlement inextricably linked to property, racial oppression, sexual control and class segregation. However online privacy is uncritically promoted by academics, activists and media discourse as a civil right and even a form of social justice. We build on the arguments of feminist, queer, Black Radical traditions and GDPR legal scholars to make three arguments to the contrary. First, privacy is not social justice, but reproduces the ideologies of colonial rankings, policing and norms (racial, sexual, able-bodied and more). Second, online privacy is inextricable from private property as the exclusive legal protection of home-owners from state oversight; a liberal privilege that is easily appropriated into corporate affordances. Third, online privacy is a myth: the Internet works because its infrastructures share knowledge inferred from data, in other words there is no actual possibility of privacy, nor any real corporate incentive to privacy, except as an optic tactic to avoid accountability. Grounded in anti-capitalist social justice, our argument exceeds current liberal civil definitions of safety, such as the Human Rights based approach to Smart Cities inspired by the United Nations, the GDPR, municipal policies and environmental law. Instead we call for public, collectivized data and the complete rejection of liberal property entitlement, gatekeeping and policing known as ""privacy"".",20250201,"Lim, Elisha ; Lisker, Mareike ; Hess, Lukas ; Engeler, Malte ; Friedman, Leah M. ; Lingel, Jessa ; Ali, Muna-Udbi",Article,Academic Journal,Feb2025,true,First Monday,Internet privacy ; Oppression ; Racism ; Private property ; Smart cities,JOUR,,,1396-0466,,,,,eng,First Monday,22,1,22,30,2,10.5210/fm.v30i2.13671,,DZZ,,https://research.ebsco.com/linkprocessor/plink?id=7057f538-e58f-33eb-9e40-3e8be3410abe
"Library, Information Science & Technology Abstracts",lxh,146502800,Online 'barebacking' community and the creation of 'sex pig' identities: Exploring affordances of a Web forum in celebrating sexual excess.,"The Internet and HIV biomedical technologies are considered as significant technological advances underpinning ""barebacking"", or condom-less anal sex among gay, bisexual, and other men who have sex with men (MSM). Online chatrooms, discussion boards, and geosocial networking applications (""apps"") are regarded as having facilitated new opportunities to meet and connect with other barebackers. Virtual spaces enabled the proliferation of online discourses specific to barebacking, such as ""bugchasing"" and ""giftgiving"" to refer to the intentional spreading of HIV. While previous research focus on the metaphors used by bugchasers and giftgivers online, such studies lack analyses of other barebacking practices and identities beyond intentional seroconversion. This paper seeks to fill this gap by examining the affordances of a barebacking online community I call ""Pigpen"" in offering space for MSM to discuss various topics apart from intentional seroconversion: in particular, the emergence of ""sex pigging"". Analyzing online forum discussions, I argue that Pigpen opens possibilities for reimagining sex pigging desires, identities, and practices that are intertwined and constituted by HIV prevention discourses and biomedical technologies. While sex pigging is associated with sexual excess, I demonstrate that limitless sex is practiced in a variety of ways: ranging from the eroticization of HIV and other STIs, to avoiding transmission by adapting some harm reduction strategies. Some sex pigs reappropriate the association of pigs with revulsion and taboo by reframing sexual excess as pleasurable and productive of feelings of freedom. By contrast, other sex pigs renegotiate risk and safety by incorporating risk minimization, giving rise to the possibility of ""safer sex pigs"". Thus, sex pigging desires, identities, and practices are more complex than previously thought because they do not neatly fall into the category of irrationality and irresponsibility.",20201001,"Daroya, Emerich",Article,Academic Journal,Oct2020,true,First Monday,Virtual communities ; Online chat ; Internet forums ; Anal sex ; Swine ; HIV prevention,JOUR,,,1396-0466,,,,,eng,First Monday,1,1,1,25,10,10.5210/fm.v25i10.10259,,DZZ,,https://research.ebsco.com/linkprocessor/plink?id=ab9977bc-7f74-39c7-9bf2-c23325bf1a79

The uses and gratifications of automated features.,"The popularity of automated features, such as autocorrect, reflects an interesting paradox in digital media use: while users appreciate the interactivity afforded by these media, they also seem to enjoy passively observing the system perform the interaction on their behalf. We aim to understand this paradox by using the concept of interpassivity and exploring the primary gratifications users seek in automated features. Following the research methods in U&G research, we first conducted three focus groups to generate a list of 66 gratification items, which were subjected to exploratory factor analysis in a survey study (N = 498). Results show that convenience, user control, and user profiling are three distinct gratifications of automated feature usage. Furthermore, user control is universally desired across features, and user profiling motivates the use of all automated features.

Despite the growing scholarly attention, little is known about how digital technologies might be designed to enable financial inclusion of women in developing countries. Using the technology affordances approach, we extend previous theorizing on inclusive information system, and introduce a relational approach to designing for inclusion. Specifically, we conduct a case study of a digital finance initiative in Ghana involving the design of an interactive voice response system (IVR) for low-income women where systemic barriers to technology adoption and use are pervasive.

With the advance of artificial intelligence and big data, digital humanities have been empowered with new research affordances. However, computational modelling on cultural datasets without a critical examination of the datasets risks decontextualized datafication and misinterpretation, which does not necessarily advance our knowledge into humanities and social sciences questions. This paper presents an exploratory investigation into 37,408 Goodreads reviews on children's books to showcase the complexities of cultural datasets online, to inform contextualized and critical cultural data analysis. Method. We conducted topic modelling and qualitative analysis of content on the reviews retrieved by regular expressions and visualized our findings. Analysis. Our analysis empirically illuminates (1) participation in reviewing children's literature online, and (2) presentation of topics and opinions in the reviews. Results. We found that although various family members across generations participate in reading children's books and reviewing them online, female members play particularly active roles, and children's opinions are underrepresented. Conclusions. In addition to gaining insights into reviews on children's books, this study also demonstrates the importance of exploratory data analysis in gaining a more nuanced understanding of cultural datasets online, which is essential for advancing insightful and critical data analysis.",20250102,"Hu, Yuerong ; Ling, Chen",Article,Academic Journal,2025 Special issue,true,Information Research,Children's literature ; Quantitative research ; Critical analysis ; Digital humanities ; Social sciences,JOUR,,,1368-1613,,,,,eng,University of Boras,595,582,14,30,,10.47989/ir30iConf47269,,EB6,,https://research.ebsco.com/linkprocessor/plink?id=8bcbbe39-ace6-3aa4-9696-9b8d2e87c7e5

It argues that a new materialist framework, which affirms the agential and self-creative powers of materiality and highlights the enmeshment of human and nonhuman agents, can illustrate the combined effects of colonialism, global capitalism and the imposition of Western epistemological categories upon the Global South. By analysing Indra Sinha’s novel Animal’s People (2007), I aim to demonstrate that a narratological methodology predicated upon New Materialist knowledge structures can explicate the consequences of Western systems of exploitation and extraction on the intermingled lives of humans and nonhumans, illustrating the interconnectedness of the struggles for racial, economic and environmental justice. The second aim of this paper is to contribute to scholarship on magical realism as ecological discourse advanced by Ben Holgate (2019), examining how Indra Sinha’s novel explores “questions about […] the place of embodied humans within a material world.” I investigate how conceptualisations of matter and material situatedness circumscribed by New Materialism can explicate how the bridging of ontologically distinct planes (“the real” and “the magical”) that magical realism hinges upon explores the intermingling of human and nonhuman actors and makes visible the non-differentiation between human subjects and the environment.",20241201,"BRICI, ALEXANDRA",Article,Academic Journal,2024,true,Philobiblon: Transylvanian Journal of Multidisciplinary Research in Humanities,Magic realism (Literature) ; Photorealism ; Environmental justice ; Developing countries ; Distributive justice ; Posthumanism,JOUR,,,1224-7448,,,,,eng,Lucian Blaga Central University Library,456,443,14,29,2,10.26424/philobib.2024.29.2.12,,2ZR1,,https://research.ebsco.com/linkprocessor/plink?id=1578346d-8601-3e6d-8284-88494c12734e

A significant challenge in many developing countries is the inability of large segments of the population—particularly, the vulnerable poor—to receive and benefit from services or public provisions because they lack a means of formal identification. Various digital identity projects worldwide have attempted to address the problem through an umbrella approach dubbed identification for development (ID4D). However, little is known about how digital identity advances e-governance by enabling socioeconomic development through inclusion. This study examines the inclusion and developmental significance of digital identity by drawing on thematic analysis of secondary data from 40 published studies based on the empirical context of India's Aadhaar—the world's largest digital identity scheme which enables service delivery to over 1.2 billion people. From our analysis, we identify themes of digital identity and socioeconomic inclusion and develop a theoretical account of their relationship. The resulting framework contributes towards advancing e-governance for development by showing how digital identity might enable inclusion. • Digital identity has been claimed to offer socioeconomic inclusion in developing countries. • There is, however, limited research on the link between digital identity and socioeconomic inclusion. • This study reviews 40 studies based on India's Aadhaar digital identity system to uncover key themes of digital identity and socioeconomic inclusion. • The article develops a theoretical framework that proposes four inclusion affordances of digital identification.",20210401,"Addo, Atta ; Senyo, P.K.",Article,Academic Journal,Apr2021,true,Government Information Quarterly,Digital inclusion ; Data analysis ; Digital media ; India ; Digital humanities ; Thematic analysis ; Public spending ; Developing countries,JOUR,,,0740-624X,,,,,eng,Elsevier B.V.,N.PAG,N.PAG,,38,2,10.1016/j.giq.2021.101568,,GIQ,,https://research.ebsco.com/linkprocessor/plink?id=0cf7a75d-7c2e-3822-91e9-6b3186701ae3

We explore the experience of transparency of three design teams who used an OCW called Miro in remote work during the COVID-19 pandemic. Our aim was to gain in-depth understanding on what constitutes transparency in this teamwork context. We conducted a qualitative interview study with 11 participants who are user experience and service designers, and who actively use Miro in their daily work. We adopted sociomateriality as our research lens and thematically analysed the data, finding that transparency at work is a dynamic experience ranging between positive and negative. Rather than being merely users' or organisations' choices or the result of the tool affordances, the experience of transparency at work is an outcome of sociomaterial entanglements between the user, tool, and organisation. Furthermore, the occupational and organisational factors not only affect the experience of transparency, but they also actively constitute it.",20241001,"Simsek Caglar, Pinar ; Vainio, Teija ; Roto, Virpi",Article,Academic Journal,Oct2024,true,Behaviour & Information Technology,World Wide Web ; Digital technology ; Qualitative research ; Research methodology ; Telecommuting ; Application software ; COVID-19 pandemic ; Access to information ; Teams in the workplace ; Corporate culture ; Interprofessional relations ; Research funding ; Peer relations ; Interviewing ; Team building ; Thematic analysis ; Trust ; Software architecture ; Employee attitudes ; Psychological vulnerability,JOUR,,,0144-929X,,,,,eng,Taylor & Francis Ltd,2906,2881,26,43,12,10.1080/0144929X.2023.2260910,,B6Q,,https://research.ebsco.com/linkprocessor/plink?id=237db997-56c2-3de6-928d-238d693c6326

The conference theme centered on revolutions, highlighting the connections between digital transformations and social movements across time and space. Focusing on the affordances of digital technologies for mobilization, resistance and achieving social justice, but also their limitations in enabling lasting social change, the conference theme asked participants to reflect on the tradeoffs between empowerment and subordination, and the relationship of digital 'revolutions' to racial justice, anticolonial movements, and the rising tide of white supremacist and fascist mobilization. This special issue includes six papers that offer new angles on critically assessing the groundbreaking early ideas underpinning online networked spaces and questioning the revolutionary potential of the internet today. The range of papers includes contexts related to platform power and user agency, online political subcultures and memeification, the balance between visibility and power for content creators revolutionizing live streaming and influencer cultural industries, and perceptions of AI's revolutionary impact on romantic relationships.

Past work has shown that public librarians increasingly endeavor to offer programs and services for those aging in place. However, research about the effects that public library services and spaces have on the lives of older adults and the affordances they bring is limited. This article presents the results of a nationwide study in which 49 public libraries participated—most from rural and small towns across the United States. More than 535 older adults engaged in a 12-week strength-training program in these libraries. Results of the study indicate that health outcomes for participants can be grouped into three interconnected categories: physical health, mental health, and social health.

Algorithms are progressively transforming human experience, especially, the interaction with businesses, governments, education, and entertainment. As a result, people are growingly seeing the outside world, in a sense, through the lens of algorithms. Despite the importance of algorithmic experience (AX), few studies had been devoted to investigating the nature and processes through which users perceive and actualize the potential for algorithm affordance. This study proposes the Algorithm Acceptance Model to conceptualize the notion of AX as part of the analytic framework for human-algorithm interaction. It then tests how AX shapes the satisfaction with and acceptance of algorithm services. The results show that AX is inherently related to human understanding of fairness, transparency, and other conventional components of user-experience, indicating the heuristic roles of transparency and fairness regarding their underlying relations of user experience and trust.

There is strong scholarship supporting the social construction perspective, arguing that the effects of technology are wholly socially and politically determined. This paper argues that the social constructivist position needs to be expanded if it can be useful for more than observing the ways technologies are designed and used. We need to develop better ways to talk about software, computer hardware, and networks, so that we can describe the social interpretations of these systems while accounting for their unique characteristics.

This paper challenges the predictive/optimizing paradigm by proposing a relational perspective on AI—one that treats uncertainty not as a problem to eliminate, but as a generative space for creativity, care, and transformation. Drawing on theories of relational agency, imagination, and hope, we explore how AI can participate in co-creating more ethical, empathetic, and ecologically attuned practices. Leveraging a preexisting case of AI-driven wildlife management in India, we conduct an analysis of a possible and desirable future, demonstrating how AI's affordances might be reconfigured and expanded: from tools of surveillance and efficiency to invitations for listening, attunement, and world-making. In this reimagined mode, AI supports not only the processing of data but the emergence of stories—enabling practitioners to sense, interpret, and respond to ecological entanglements in ways that foreground more-than-human perspectives and collective vulnerability. We contribute to the growing discourse on sustainable AI by theorizing how practices of imagination and hope can cultivate response-able agency—a form of ethical responsiveness grounded in interdependence rather than mastery. Ultimately, we call for a reorientation of AI design and governance toward practices that do not merely optimize what is, but help bring forth what could be. • We call for moving beyond the dominant predictive/optimizing paradigm on AI for sustainability, and propose a relational perspective on AI that treats uncertainty not as a problem to eliminate, but as a generative space for creativity, care, and transformation. • Building on an existing case of the use of AI in wildlife management in India, we conduct an analysis of a possible and desirable future, demonstrating how AI's affordances might be reconfigured and expanded: from tools of surveillance and efficiency to invitations for listening, attunement, and world-making • Employing imagination allows us to transcend the limitations of the present, inviting us to co-create with AI and the environment, and cultivating hope opens up space for acknowledging the inherent uncertainty and indeterminacy of the future.

Design/methodology/approach: The data was collected from a large-scale online survey of 1208 young people in mainland China. Zero-order correlation analyses and structural equation modeling were carried out to examine the corresponding hypotheses. Findings: Obtained findings show that WeChat use for informational and social motivations are positively associated with bonding and bridging social capital. Moreover, bonding social capital could mediate the relationship between WeChat usage for informational and relational motivations and civic engagement. Research limitations/implications: Theoretically, this article underlines the unique social and technological affordances of WeChat by exploring mobile social media use and how it would contribute to the quality of democracy by fostering young people's engagement in civic life. Practically, bridging and bonding social capital play significant roles in enhancing young people's civic engagement, which could be the meaningful resource for mobile social media designers, managers and government officials.

We piloted a VTS-centered focus group discussion with three groups of community residents in Pennsylvania's Lehigh Valley. Thematic coding of observations in the discussion groups suggest that a VTS-centered focus group is an effective approach to evaluate audience meaning-making by prompting slow looking, protracted discussion, and offering a structure for discussion that keeps the facilitator from shaping topics of conversation.

We build on sociological understandings of narrative and storytelling to identify and describe three interactive storytelling practices that are facilitated by the affordances of these digital spaces: repetition, co-creation, and elaboration. These practices enable incel participants to share similar experiences, apply elements of the incel ideology to interpret off-line events, and elaborate boundaries between incels and those that they perceive as ""normies"".

To understand how these imaginaries are spatially shaped and locally defined, we carried out in-depth qualitative research with fifty filmmakers in four regions of Ghana. Digital and platform technologies have long been optimistically celebrated as a way for marginalized creative entrepreneurs, particularly in Africa, to break into global markets and reach unprecedented levels of business success. However, far from being universally adopted by African creative entrepreneurs, these global techno-optimistic imaginaries are continually reworked, contested and subverted in practice. In this article, we show how Ghanaian filmmakers mobilized, deployed and resisted imaginaries of platform entrepreneurship in their efforts to make sense of their situated entrepreneurial practices and to imagine the future of their creative businesses. We found that rather than naïvely adhering to techno-optimist imaginaries, through their practices, Ghanaian filmmaking entrepreneurs challenged the power geometry of the current platform ecosystem dominated by major Silicon Valley players. We contribute empirically rich data on how filmmaking entrepreneurs use and imagine platform technologies, as is necessary when African digital entrepreneurs are surrounded by hype but inadequate data. We also contribute to the literature about how individual platforms and platform types have unique affordances and how these affordances are shaped by the location and socio-economic position of the entrepreneur.",20230901,"Steedman, Robin ; Alacovska, Ana ; Langevang, Thilde ; Resario, Rashida",Article,Academic Journal,Sep2023,true,"Information, Communication & Society","Digital technology ; Ghana ; Cultural industries ; Filmmaking ; Business success ; Silicon Valley (Santa Clara County, Calif.) ; Businesspeople ; Entrepreneurship",JOUR,,,1369-118X,,,,,eng,Taylor & Francis Ltd,1995,1979,17,26,10,10.1080/1369118X.2022.2062252,,5BA,,https://research.ebsco.com/linkprocessor/plink?id=9054cb8e-29d4-3aa6-8622-ef63f125c704

We examined the roles of motivations in the effect of social media use on risk exposure and risk attitude.<bold>Results: </bold>Motivations for social media use included agency, self-expression, realism, social learning, social comparison, and filter. These motivations were associated differentially with the frequency of use of Facebook, Instagram, Snapchat, and YouTube. Frequency of social media use was positively associated with exposure to e-cigarette messages across the four platforms (Ps<.001). Exposure to e-cigarette messages on Instagram (P=.005) and Snapchat (P=.03) was positively associated with attitude toward e-cigarette use. Perceived social media realism moderated the effects of e-cigarette message exposure such that when realism was high, the exposure effect was amplified, but when realism was low, the effect was mitigated (P<.001). A three-way interaction effect (P=.02) among exposure, social learning motivation, and social norm on attitude toward e-cigarette use was found. When perceived social norm was high, the moderating effect of social learning motivation on e-cigarette use attitude was amplified, but when social norm was low, the social learning motivation effect was attenuated.<bold>Conclusions: </bold>Because perceived social media realism moderates the effect of exposure to e-cigarette messages on attitude toward e-cigarette use, future intervention efforts should address the realism perceptions.

The mediating role of intrinsic satisfaction needs.,"Purpose: This study employed self-determination theory (SDT) and the ""Motivational affordance–Psychological outcomes–Behavioral outcomes"" framework to investigate the relationship between gamification features and knowledge-sharing behavior in online communities. Design/methodology/approach: A theoretical model was tested with 281 Chinese users from an online social question and answer (Q&A) community. Partial least square structural equation modeling was applied to analyze the data. Findings: The empirical results revealed that competence mediated the effects of immersion and achievement-related gamification features on knowledge sharing. Moreover, relatedness mediated the effects of immersion, achievement and social-related gamification features on knowledge sharing. Research limitations/implications: This study was conducted on a Chinese Q&A platform, and the results may not be generalizable to other cultures or service providers with different goals. Practical implications: The study's findings indicate that gamification could serve as an effective toolkit for incentivizing and promoting knowledge sharing in online communities. The findings thus provide strategic insights for administrators of online communities seeking to leverage gamification designs to encourage user participation in knowledge-sharing activities. Originality/value: Research on the role of gamification in promoting knowledge sharing has been limited in scope and has focused on tourism comment communities. Little evidence exists on the effect of gamification within social Q&A communities. Further, the finding of gamification's positive role in motivating knowledge sharing indicates the need for the knowledge-sharing field to focus on contextual factors.",20240301,"Cai, Yang ; Li, Xiujun ; Shi, Wendian",Article,Academic Journal,2024,true,Online Information Review,Virtual communities ; Information sharing ; Question & answer websites ; Satisfaction ; Gamification ; Self-determination theory,JOUR,,,1468-4527,,,,,eng,Emerald Publishing Limited,373,354,20,48,2,10.1108/OIR-05-2021-0288,,9NA,,https://research.ebsco.com/linkprocessor/plink?id=86196423-d86c-3d68-b4ef-9e28f0aa0766

However, limited research has examined the role of social media in a physicians' online return. This study, therefore, investigates physicians' online economic and social capital return in relation to physicians' use of social media and consumer engagement. Design/methodology/approach: Using ordinary least squares (OLS) regression with fixed effects (FE) and panel data collected from Sina Weibo and Sina Health, this study analyzes the impact of physicians' social media use and consumer engagement on physicians' online return and the moderation effect of professional seniority. Findings: The results reveal that physicians' use of social media and consumer sharing behavior positively affect physicians' online economic return. In contrast, consumer engagement positively impacts physicians' online social capital return. While professional seniority enhances the effect of physicians' social media use on online economic return, professional seniority only enhances the relationship between consumers' sharing behavior to the posts and physicians' online social capital return when professional seniority comes to consumer engagement.

"Library, Information Science & Technology Abstracts",lxh,176075517,The role of institutional and self in the formation of trust in artificial intelligence technologies.,"Purpose: The deployment of artificial intelligence (AI) technologies in travel and tourism has received much attention in the wake of the pandemic. While societal adoption of AI has accelerated, it also raises some trust challenges. Literature on trust in AI is scant, especially regarding the vulnerabilities faced by different stakeholders to inform policy and practice. This work proposes a framework to understand the use of AI technologies from the perspectives of institutional and the self to understand the formation of trust in the mandated use of AI-based technologies in travelers. Design/methodology/approach: An empirical investigation using partial least squares-structural equation modeling was employed on responses from 209 users. This paper considered factors related to the self (perceptions of self-threat, privacy empowerment, trust propensity) and institution (regulatory protection, corporate privacy responsibility) to understand the formation of trust in AI use for travelers. Findings: Results showed that self-threat, trust propensity and regulatory protection influence trust in users on AI use. Privacy empowerment and corporate responsibility do not. Originality/value: Insights from the past studies on AI in travel and tourism are limited. This study advances current literature on affordance and reactance theories to provide a better understanding of what makes travelers trust the mandated use of AI technologies. This work also demonstrates the paradoxical effects of self and institution on technologies and their relationship to trust.

This is nowhere better exemplified than on the platform Archive of Our Own (AO3), which hosts over 13 million stories in thousands of fandoms. AO3 is one of the most popular online repositories for fanfiction and growing exponentially, precisely because of how it deals with this slew of data: its system of extensive hyperlinked labelling. Based on empirical participant data from an online survey and semi-structured interviews, I argue that tags offer distinct affordances and affect user behaviour in such a way that new reading practices arise. Tags create a literacy paradigm interwoven with virtuality, relying on links and networks, and featuring a unique set of characteristics that differentiate reading on AO3 from other digital reading platforms, as well as from print fiction.

This interplay and placement can communicate movement, stillness, suspense, bringing the reader along not only through content or story arc but also through the material affordances, the physical reality of the comic in combination with the technology. The findings of this exploratory study reveal both the varied reading experiences of digital comics as well as the shared experiences of haptic interactions and emotional perception and reaction through the use of devices, comics platforms and apps, and social media.

"Library, Information Science & Technology Abstracts",lxh,108366841,Redefining privacy and anonymity through social networking affordances.,"Social networking sites allow people to create, broadcast, and interpret the self in new and evolving ways. While early online social media studies praised the Internet for providing an anonymous space in which to experiment with identity, more recent research suggests that social networking sites have become not anonymous, as they compel users to perform identity in new ways. Through a novel application of affordance theory, this paper argues that instead of attempting to apply outdated definitions of privacy to social networking spaces, we should instead be discussing our right to anonymity. I argue that privacy is immaterial due to the fact that from the moment we log in and interact with a social media interface, we have shared some type of personal information with someone. Anonymity, on the other hand, is defined as the unlinkability of our many identifications. Thus, instead of attempting to define ideas such as ""personal"" and ""private,"" we should instead fight for the separation of selves, both at the social and institutional level.",20150701,"Cirucci, Angela M.",Article,Academic Journal,Jul2015,true,First Monday,Social media ; Right of privacy ; Online social networks ; Internet privacy ; Anonymity,JOUR,,,1396-0466,,,,,eng,First Monday,9,1,9,20,7,10.5210/fm.v20i7.5465,,DZZ,,https://research.ebsco.com/linkprocessor/plink?id=66efa058-2021-30f7-9e59-7e672209df0c
"Library, Information Science & Technology Abstracts",lxh,164449672,Sharing in the echo chamber: Examining Instagram users' engagement with infographics through the frame of digital literacy.,"Social media platforms have had a tangible effect on how users share information and their digital literacy skills. Infographics are often shared on Instagram, but they harbour the potential for misinformation. Users do not always research posts before sharing, and the social nature of the site influences user behaviour. Current digital literacy theories highlight the need to integrate digital technologies into traditional information literacy theories, because technologies are increasingly central to everyday life and information consumption. In this article, I investigated digital literacy from a user perspective, examining how users' digital literacy skills interact with their sharing of infographics. I also examined how infographics are used for activism, and the social and visual affordances of Instagram, which helped to dictate the users' relationship with digital literacy. I conducted a qualitative study consisting of interviews with six participants. Participants were asked about their Instagram behaviour, infographic selection, and how they judge the reliability of an infographic before sharing. Participant responses were analysed using a grounded theory approach. Responses revealed that users are familiar with traditional concepts of information literacy, such as referencing sources, but often prioritise other areas, such as the social and personal contexts of an infographic when deciding what to share. Users also dialogue with online followers using visual imagery and activism. These sharing practices are contextualised within Instagram affordances and the behaviours the platform enables and constrains. The study is novel in examining digital literacy as enacted through Instagram, specifically the use of infographics, while also foregrounding the user perspective. The results emphasise the need to consider user perspectives in digital literacy whether conducting research or teaching.",20230601,"Burrows, Ella",Article,Academic Journal,Jun2023,true,Journal of Information Literacy,Digital literacy ; Social media ; Information literacy ; United Kingdom ; Activism ; Information design,JOUR,,,1750-5968,,,,,eng,CILIP Information Literacy Group,47,29,19,17,1,10.11645/17.1.3360,,784T,,https://research.ebsco.com/linkprocessor/plink?id=300729f4-9d70-3096-8175-09190b01cd72
"Library, Information Science & Technology Abstracts",lxh,182059132,Alternative Health and Conventional Medicine Discourse About Cancer on TikTok: Computer Vision Analysis of TikTok Videos.,"Background: Health misinformation is abundant online and becoming an increasingly pressing concern for both oncology practitioners and patients with cancer. On social media platforms, including the popular audiovisual app TikTok, the flourishing alternative health industry is further contributing to the spread of misleading and often harmful information, endangering patients' health and outcomes and sowing distrust of the medical community. The prevalence of false and potentially dangerous treatments on a platform that is used as a quasi–search engine by young people poses a serious risk to the health of patients with cancer. Objective: This study seeks to examine how cancer discourse on TikTok differs between alternative health and conventional medicine videos. It aims to look beyond mere facts and falsehoods that TikTok users may utter to understand the visual language and format used in the support of both misleading and truthful narratives, as well as other messages. Methods: Using computer vision analysis and subsequent qualitative close reading of 831 TikTok videos, this study examined how alternative health and conventional medicine videos on cancer differ with regard to the visual language used. Videos were examined for the length of time and prominence in which faces are displayed, as well as for the background setting, location, and dominant color scheme. Results: The results show that the alt-health and conventional health samples made different use of the audiovisual affordances of TikTok. First, videos from the alternative health sample were more likely to contain a single face that was prominently featured (making up at least 7.5% of the image) for a substantial period of time (35% of the shots), with these testimonial-style videos making up 28.5% (93/326) of the sample compared to 18.6% (94/505) of the conventional medicine sample. Alternative health videos predominantly featured cool tones (P <.001) and were significantly more likely to be filmed outdoors (P <.001), whereas conventional medicine videos were more likely to be shot indoors and feature warm tones such as red, orange, or yellow. Conclusions: The findings of this study contribute to an increased understanding of misinformation as not merely a matter of individual falsehoods but also a phenomenon whose effects might be transported through emotive as well as rational means. They also point to influencer practices and style being an important contributing factor in the declining health of the information environment around cancer and its treatment. The results suggest that public health efforts must extend beyond correcting false statements by injecting factual information into the online cancer discourse and look toward incorporating both visual and rational strategies.",20240101,"Muenster, Roxana Mika ; Gangi, Kai ; Margolin, Drew",Article,Academic Journal,2024,true,Journal of Medical Internet Research,Social media ; Young adults ; Medical mistrust ; Computer vision ; False testimony,JOUR,,,1439-4456,,,,,eng,JMIR Publications Inc.,16,1,16,26,,10.2196/60283,,DNC,,https://research.ebsco.com/linkprocessor/plink?id=2ba78cf4-5fb7-3536-b3fd-5d184dda26ce

Objective: This study aims to describe (1) how tailoring and personalization are defined in the literature and by eHealth experts, and what the differences and similarities are; (2) what type of variables can be used to segment eHealth users into more homogeneous groups or at the individual level; (3) what elements of eHealth technologies are adapted to these segments; and (4) how the segments are matched with eHealth adaptations. Methods: We used a multimethod qualitative study design. To gain insights into the definitions of personalization and tailoring, definitions were collected from the literature and through interviews with eHealth experts. In addition, the interviews included questions about how users can be segmented and how eHealth can be adapted accordingly, and responses to 3 vignettes of examples of eHealth technologies, varying in personalization and tailoring strategies to elicit responses about views from stakeholders on how the two components were applied and matched in different contexts. Results: A total of 28 unique definitions of tailoring and 16 unique definitions of personalization were collected from the literature and interviews. The definitions of tailoring and personalization varied in their components, namely adaptation, individuals, user groups, preferences, symptoms, characteristics, context, behavior, content, identification, feedback, channel, design, computerization, and outcomes. During the interviews, participants mentioned 9 types of variables that can be used to segment eHealth users, namely demographics, preferences, health variables, psychological variables, behavioral variables, individual determinants, environmental information, intervention interaction, and technology variables. In total, 5 elements were mentioned that can be adapted to those segments, namely channeling, content, graphical, functionalities, and behavior change strategy. Participants mentioned substantiation methods and variable levels as two components for matching the segmentations with adaptations. Conclusions: Tailoring and personalization are multidimensional concepts, and variability and technology affordances seem to determine whether and how personalization and tailoring should be applied to eHealth technologies. On the basis of our findings, tailoring and personalization can be differentiated by the way that segmentations and adaptations are matched. Tailoring matches segmentations and adaptations based on general group characteristics using if-then algorithms, whereas personalization involves the direct insertion of user information (such as name) or adaptations based on individual-level inferences. We argue that future research should focus on how inferences can be made at the individual level to further develop the field of personalized eHealth.",20240101,"ten Klooster, Iris ; Kip, Hanneke ; Beyer, Sina L ; van Gemert-Pijnen, Lisette J E W C ; Kelders, Saskia M",Article,Academic Journal,2024,true,Journal of Medical Internet Research,Automation ; Experimental design ; Qualitative research ; Tailoring ; Vignettes,JOUR,,,1439-4456,,,,,eng,JMIR Publications Inc.,20,1,20,26,,10.2196/50497,,DNC,,https://research.ebsco.com/linkprocessor/plink?id=e790adcf-c655-3b0f-b337-5319b0961a1f

To do so, we examine how American singer-songwriter Britney Spears is framed in the stories that tabloid journalists, Wikipedia editors, and Twitter users tell about her online. Using Spears’ portrayal as a case study, we hope to better understand how subversive stories come to prominence online, and how platform affordances and incentives can encourage or discourage their emergence. We draw upon previous work on the portrayal of women and mental illness in news and tabloid media, as well as work on narrative formation on Wikipedia.

This article interrogates the role of the knowledge influencer, or those who perform micro-celebrity to convey information and expertise to lay audiences. Knowledge influencers can be doctors, lawyers, or anyone, regardless of class, who is an expert in their occupation. In doing so, knowledge influencers perform what I call calibrated expertise, or the curated performance strategy in which experts harness social media affordances, platform dynamics, and aspects of micro-celebrity to impart information. Through a case study analysis of social media veterinarians on Instagram, I show how calibrated expertise is discursively performed, and knowledge influencers emerge, at a cultural moment in which neoliberalism continues to blur the lines between work and play, and populist backlashes against experts are ubiquitous. By navigating micro-celebrity, authenticity, and relatability, knowledge influencers put a human face and contemporary cultural spin on expertise.

"Library, Information Science & Technology Abstracts",lxh,187748878,"Empowering international PhD students: Generative AI, Ubuntu, and the decolonisation of academic communication.","Generative AI (GenAI) provides distinct affordances that contribute meaningfully to learning. However, there are also several challenges, most notably ethical considerations. While much of the current research on GenAI in academia focuses on technical capabilities or ethical concerns, few studies have examined how GenAI can be leveraged to promote equity and inclusivity, particularly in academic communication. In this study, we adopt the theoretical lens of Ubuntu, a Southern African philosophy that emphasises interconnectedness and community, to reconceptualise GenAI as a democratising force. Five international PhD students in Education and their PhD supervisor (all multilingual users of English) explored their experiences of using GenAI. We used a collaborative autoethnographic approach, incorporating reflective prompting, individual writing, group sharing and refining, and group-based writing. We demonstrate that GenAI reshaped power dynamics and challenged academic hierarchies by providing real-time language support and improving academic writing clarity. This empowered us to participate in academic discourse, disrupting traditional gatekeeping mechanisms. By automating routine tasks, GenAI also shifted our academic focus from technical skills to intellectual contributions, fostering inclusivity and equity. This study highlights the potential of GenAI in terms of knowledge creation and academic discourse, particularly for doctoral scholars navigating linguistic and cultural barriers. Academia is predominantly Anglophone-centric, marginalising non-English-speaking scholars by imposing additional barriers to participation and recognition, perpetuating inequities in knowledge creation and dissemination. We argue that embracing GenAI can help to decolonise these academic practices, thereby promoting epistemic justice and creating a more equitable scholarly environment for all. • Reframes generative AI as a tool for decolonising academia. • Highlights generative AI's role in navigating academic and social spaces. • Advocates for generative AI as a tool to empower individual agency. • Explores international PhD students' use of generative AI using autoethnography. • Uses Ubuntu to champion an academic culture where equity and innovation co-exist.",20251001,"Pretorius, Lynette ; Huynh, Huy-Hoang ; Pudyanti, Anak Agung Ayu Redi ; Li, Ziqi ; Noori, Abdul Qawi ; Zhou, Zhiheng",Article,Academic Journal,Oct2025,true,Internet & Higher Education,Generative artificial intelligence ; Decolonization ; Autoethnography ; Participation ; Scholarly communication ; Doctoral students ; Solidarity ; Equality,JOUR,,,1096-7516,,,,,eng,Elsevier B.V.,N.PAG,N.PAG,,67,,10.1016/j.iheduc.2025.101038,,5CO,,https://research.ebsco.com/linkprocessor/plink?id=1d81688a-5d87-36d4-884c-0f4006a5d2b9

While literature is extensive in using technologies in learning and teaching in the West, and in teaching international students, there is a lack of research focusing on employing emerging technologies with transnational students in Asia. A multilayered approach to data collection through observation of software analytics, questionnaire and focus groups has resulted in the introduction of new technologies, through which a community of practice, encompassing students in HK and the UK, has emerged.

However, the specific impact ICT has on refugee entrepreneurship is not fully understood. This study addresses the research gap by investigating the role ICT plays in enabling entrepreneurial activities among refugees in the Dzaleka refugee camp in Malawi. Drawing on 25 structured interviews we explore the opportunities and challenges faced by refugee entrepreneurs in this context. A critical realist approach is leveraged to identify the stages of business growth where ICT is an important driver and uncover other mechanisms that both enable and/or constrain entrepreneurship. Analysis suggests four generative mechanisms that either enable or constrain refugee business entrepreneurship. The most important finding is that the survival of refugee businesses is facilitated by the market mechanism, with only the growth stage significantly influenced by ICT. Our findings directly conflict with the existing literature that suggests ICT is essential for fostering business entrepreneurship among refugees. This work offers a unique framework for policy interventions that provides guidance on the circumstances, the type of technology and the way it should be leveraged in order to facilitate entrepreneurship.",20220101,"Brown, Suzana ; Saxena, Deepak ; Wall, P.

A comparison is drawn between experiences of interacting with an archive presented as a narrative non-fiction audio performance and the same core material displayed as online text and images. The findings derive from an analysis of data collected in interviews with participants familiar with both versions of the archive: (1) as a podcast series entitled Diary of the War, and (2) photographs in the LornaL journal on the Blipfoto platform. The interviewees exhibited greater levels of engagement with the podcast series as a form of entertainment that prompts learning and generates emotional responses. They also found the podcast series a more flexible platform for engagement. They believed that the Blipfoto journal offers greater affordances in respect of access to contextual information, and authenticity. Key to these findings is the addition of contextual resources to the core archive in each presentation.

The results indicate that self-controlled spaces are not used for disrupting the basis for repression – the local logic of oppression – or its cocoon of collective post-colonial amnesia. Nor were spaces used for re-constructive engaging with transnational and development partners' unwitting impact on global south actors' agency and legitimacy. Instead, with a few exceptions, spaces displayed a conspicuous uniform human rights advocacy rhetoric, and Western identity labels summarized in the LGBT+ acronym. The interviews with social media content producers suggest that the LGBT+ community's dependency on international support may sway actors into what we call performative visibility, in self-controlled spaces. The study concludes that future analysis of Global South based activist's use of social media spaces' affordances including its potential for supporting de-colonialization efforts, must approach use as relational to actors' dependency on key resources such as funding and protection through affiliation.",20230925,"Strand, Cecilia ; Svensson, Jakob",Article,Academic Journal,Sep2023,true,"Information, Communication & Society",Social media ; Uganda ; Activism ; Developing countries ; Social space ; Human rights advocacy ; Semi-structured interviews,JOUR,,,1369-118X,,,,,eng,Taylor & Francis Ltd,2505,2488,18,26,12,10.1080/1369118X.2023.2252505,,5BA,,https://research.ebsco.com/linkprocessor/plink?id=4fd7d8cd-20e6-360b-b8c3-7e192320d633

"Library, Information Science & Technology Abstracts",lxh,172230384,Seeing into the future: Anchoring strategies in future-oriented Twitter visuals.,"How do public actors visualize the future? Mediations of the future often construct audiences’ prospective actions, and offer insights into society’s imagination of desirable and undesirable futures. In the visually-saturated environment of social media, projections are often visual. Unlike their textual counterparts, future-oriented election visuals have remained understudied. Thus, our paper explores how public actors substantiate their future-oriented, multi-modal claims and the rhetorical outcomes of different strategies. Building on the notion of technologies’ “temporal affordances”, we utilize an inductive qualitative approach to visual rhetoric and analyze projection anchoring strategies using a sample of 400 future-oriented multi-modal tweets. We find that anchoring is carried out in two layers: evidential (the validity of the future-oriented narrative), and visual (the level of aesthetic realism in the image). Examining recurring patterns of anchoring strategies across the sample result in a rhetorical typology of future-oriented visuals, in two modes (consumerism and competition). Overall, our findings highlight the rhetorical pliability of visual anchoring, through which actors utilize an interplay of temporal and technological strategies to generate alternative anchoring in sharing their projections, and to remain authentic in visualizing the unknown.",20230901,"Amit-Danhi, Eedan ; Aharoni, Tali",Article,Academic Journal,Sep2023,true,First Monday,Social media ; Visual communication ; Public spaces ; Social context ; Consumerism,JOUR,,,1396-0466,,,,,eng,First Monday,24,1,24,28,9,10.5210/fm.v28i9.12884,,DZZ,,https://research.ebsco.com/linkprocessor/plink?id=0c1b55b3-135a-3fcc-a633-7f0bbfffcacd

"Library, Information Science & Technology Abstracts",lxh,152096789,Hashtag activism and the configuration of counterpublics: Dutch animal welfare debates on Twitter.,"Social media platforms provide major opportunities for online activism and the emergence of digital counterpublics. Research on counterpublics has focused on actors and their narrative strategies aiming at deconstructing dominant discourses. Less attention has been paid to how the interplay between actors and platform-specific functions affects the configurations and therewith also the success of digital counterpublics. Existing studies mainly rely on determining up front which topics, actor characteristics, or arguments constitute hashtag activism and digital counterpublics. In contrast, our approach allows for an empirical identification based on how actors position themselves in an online debate toward other actors and their shared hashtags. We argue that online activism is co-constituted by actors and their usage of hashtags, actor mentions, and retweets. Applying a communicative network perspective allows for the integration of semantic and relational research traditions. We combine a recently developed automated network analysis method and content analysis to analyze two Twitter debates about animal welfare issues. Our results show that among Twitter users, citizens and environmental organizations formed a common cluster whereas media actors formed their own sub-clusters in both debates. The findings emphasize the central role of citizens for the configuration of digital counterpublics. The proposed approach can be further adapted and applied more widely for the analysis of online activism and debates.",20210915,"Wonneberger, Anke ; Hellsten, Iina R. ; Jacobs, Sandra H.

This paper addresses this concern by exploring what empirical evidence currently exists about the effects stemming from OGD in the case literature. Through the use of a literature review, 17 papers capturing empirical evidence were identified and, from these papers, a systematic collection of statements was extracted from which 173 were retained to construct what we term nine stylised facts.

Design/methodology/approach: Adopting the social network ties perspective, this study examines how task characteristics (i.e. task complexity, task interdependence and task non-routineness) affect employee agility by promoting their social network ties (i.e. instrumental ties and expressive ties) and how ESM visibility moderates their relationships. Data gathered from 341 ESM users in workplaces were analyzed using Smart-PLS 3.2. Findings: First, task complexity, task interdependence and task non-routineness have positive effects on instrumental and expressive ties, which in turn influences agility; Second, instrumental ties have a stronger effect on employee agility relative to expressive ties; Finally, ESM visibility positively moderates the effects of task complexity and task non-routineness on social network ties. Practical implications: The findings provide guidance for organizational managers on how to use task characteristics and ESM to improve employee agility, as well as insights for social media designers to optimize ESM functions to improve agility. Originality/value: This study provides empirical evidence to explain the roles of task characteristics and social network ties in influencing employee agility, thus clarifying the inconsistent findings in extant research.

This paper addresses the social effects of content ratings through a case study of Reddit. Reddit is a social news site on which users in topic-based communities (subreddits) create posts upon which others upvote, downvote, and comment. Vote scores indicate convergence with, and divergence from, community norms. Analysing data from the platform's three most popular subreddits, we ask: How do rating features afford emotional expression and content engagement? Findings from a Variable-Lag Granger Causality model show that for a portion of Reddit users (14.5%), vote scores predict subsequent emotional expression, with upvotes preceding positive sentiments and downvotes preceding negative sentiments. This is the first systematic test of how ratings influence emotional expression on a social media platform. Findings also show that downvoted content receives higher levels of engagement than upvoted content. Together, these findings suggest a paradox in which divergence from community norms, as indicated by vote score patterns, have emotional consequences and attention rewards.",20210401,"Davis, Jenny L. ; Graham, Timothy",Article,Academic Journal,Apr2021,true,"Information, Communication & Society",Internet forums ; Social media ; Reward (Psychology) ; Self-expression ; Attention ; User-generated content,JOUR,,,1369-118X,,,,,eng,Taylor & Francis Ltd,666,649,18,24,5,10.1080/1369118X.2021.1874476,,5BA,,https://research.ebsco.com/linkprocessor/plink?id=9376c0b6-45a9-330c-b623-26e910213a19
"Library, Information Science & Technology Abstracts",lxh,147988435,Friendship and politics don't mix? The role of sociability for online political talk.,"Political talk is valuable for citizens in democracy – particularly cross-cutting talk to heterogeneous others. Yet the role played by sociability in relation to political talk has not been sufficiently understood. When we talk politics with people with whom we have social relationships, does this promote open political talk by creating mutual understanding and intimacy? Or is candid political expression hindered by attempts to maintain harmony? This paper examines the role of sociability for online political talk, through a unique opportunity to compare two naturally occurring groups on the mobile instant-messaging application WhatsApp. Both groups engage in informal political talk, but while one group is devoted to political talk solely, the other mixes politics with social chit-chat, enabling social interaction and friendships among participants. A comparison of the groups based on in-depth interviews with 20 members and the groups' administrator, complemented by excerpts of discussion content, allows to trace the role of sociability for political talk in online groups. Findings point to an increased personal and emotional dimension to the group combining politics and sociability. This kind of political talk was perceived as riskier and more challenging. At the same time, it is in this group that cross-cutting exposure had a stronger potential to persuade participants to see and understand 'the other side.' These findings highlight how not only certain social media – but even certain groups within the same platform – can afford different kinds of political talk.",20210101,"Kligler-Vilenchik, Neta",Article,Academic Journal,Jan2021,true,"Information, Communication & Society",Mobile apps ; Sociability ; Social interaction ; Friendship ; Practical politics,JOUR,,,1369-118X,,,,,eng,Taylor & Francis Ltd,133,118,16,24,1,10.1080/1369118X.2019.1635185,,5BA,,https://research.ebsco.com/linkprocessor/plink?id=a5bad1e8-be00-3cd0-b3fa-8cc37c2057f8

Filling this gap, this study explores organisational newcomers' use of WeChat, the most popular public social media in China. Findings from interviews with organisational newcomers who primarily use WeChat for work suggest that they find useful official and unofficial information from their companies' WeChat public accounts, WeChat workgroups, and their coworkers' posts. Affordances of social media, such as persistence of information and visibility of content, enable distinctive experiences of information receiving and seeking for newcomers. Organisational newcomers obtain information that is otherwise not available in offline settings and seek information in unique ways, such as extracting information from chat histories. Observing conversations in WeChat groups and reading their coworkers' posts enables ambient awareness of their coworkers and companies, which facilitates organisational identification. Despite the information benefits, the participants also perceived paradoxes in their experience, struggling with whether they should always keep an eye on information from WeChat, being overwhelmed by too much irrelevant information, and being uncertain about which information strategies were appropriate.

"Library, Information Science & Technology Abstracts",lxh,164871813,'There will be screen caps': the role of digital documentation and platform collapse in propagation and visibility of racial discourses.,"Digital technologies facilitate the existence of online spaces where understandings about race and racial inequality are co-created and contested as part of social networks and within the context of existing power relations and social identities. This project qualitatively explores US college students' exposure to and experiences with content on social media that they consider to be related to race and racial discrimination. Based on analysis of focus groups, we highlight the role of digital documentation, mediated spillover, and platform collapse as key processes in propagation and communication visibility of racial discourses. We begin by delineating first level-digital documentation that digitally captures local campus and national events from second-level digital documentation – the copying of already digitized content (e.g., via screenshotting). We then introduce the concept of 'platform collapse' – second-level digital documentation that enables mediated spillover of content in ways that disrupt discourse architectures, affordances, and audience contexts. Platform collapse emerged in student discussions of how content was documented and moved from relatively private to more public spaces to call attention to racist events, messages, and behavior, and to spur conversations and action. This extended reach and frequency, and also changed the context of racial discourses. Conversely, there was also evidence of platform collapse where content was moved from public to more private spaces to address social groundlessness and avoid masspersonal engagement on social media. We conclude by discussing implications of digital documentation and platform collapse for communication theory and methods.",20230701,"Bigman, Cabral A. ; Planey, Arrianna Marie ; Williamson, Lillie D. ; Smith, Marisa A. ; McNeil Smith, Shardé",Article,Academic Journal,Jul2023,true,"Information, Communication & Society",Digital technology ; Public spaces ; Race discrimination ; Racial inequality ; Young adults ; Discourse,JOUR,,,1369-118X,,,,,eng,Taylor & Francis Ltd,1829,1812,18,26,9,10.1080/1369118X.2022.2041698,,5BA,,https://research.ebsco.com/linkprocessor/plink?id=f7599b16-5df0-34e1-8303-d909157f7727

A thematic analysis of the narratives showed that apart from acknowledging lingering trauma and suffering, the survivors questioned mainstream portrayals and assumptions about sexual abuse. Many survivors also highlighted the dilemmas associated with confiding about sexual abuse in Indian parents who often focus on family honor and reputation. Shedding anonymity, an affordance offered by the online medium, a majority of the survivors shared identifying information about themselves thereby taking a strong stand against victim-blaming and silencing. By posting self-disclosures of sexual violence and abuse on a news website, the survivors expanded the boundaries of the 'parallel public sphere' in the Indian context where issues about sexuality are often limited to the advice columns of women's magazines.

"Library, Information Science & Technology Abstracts",lxh,164418132,Online political participation: the evolution of a concept.,"The advent of online technologies has been triggering a wave of empirical examinations of online political participation (OPP) over the past twenty years. It also stimulated scholarly debate on how to conceptualize political participation in a digital age. Scholars differ on whether to consider passive and expressive online behaviors part of or a mere precursor to political participation. This study argues that due to its rapid evolution as well as its dependence on platform affordances, quantitative empirical studies on OPP may be prone to deviations between established, much-cited definitions and measurements applied in the field. Based on a systematic literature review of 289 international peer-reviewed survey-based and experimental studies, we analyze both definitions and measurements of OPP. We find a series of disconnections: Measures preponderantly address online activities, yet merely a small share of definitions focuses on the online sphere. While only few definitions account for passive activities (e.g., reading news about politics), many operationalizations include measures capturing such passive behaviors. Expressive activities are most popular in measures of OPP, but definitions rarely reflect this focus. Finally, while measures of OPP are prone to be platform-specific, definitions tend to neglect this characteristic. We conclude by reflecting the conceptual implications of common measurement practices for the study of OPP.",20230615,"Ruess, Christina ; Hoffmann, Christian Pieter ; Boulianne, Shelley ; Heger, Katharina",Article,Academic Journal,Jun2023,true,"Information, Communication & Society",Digital technology ; Quantitative research ; Political participation ; Expressive behavior ; Passivity (Psychology),JOUR,,,1369-118X,,,,,eng,Taylor & Francis Ltd,1512,1495,18,26,8,10.1080/1369118X.2021.2013919,,5BA,,https://research.ebsco.com/linkprocessor/plink?id=9941dd65-dfeb-3608-8683-814714751a81
"Library, Information Science & Technology Abstracts",lxh,163409031,Digital mobilization via attention building: The logic of cross-boundary actions in the 2019 Hong Kong social movement.,"Scholars have noticed that contemporary digitally-mediated activism is hybridized in terms of organizational structures, action-repertoires, and underlying movement logics. However, to what extent such hybridization takes place in contentious politics and whether or not the process benefits the goal of movement mobilization remain uncertain. This study scrutinizes the mechanism of online activism in an analysis of 2 million Telegram Channel messages collected during the 2019 Hong Kong Anti-Extradition Law Amendment Bill movement. It highlights the logic of cross-boundary action – a mixture of action actors, organizational structures, repertoires, network positions for empowerment – through which self-organized activists played overwhelmingly vital roles in the movement but were critically supported by small numbers of organizational and news media actors in some essential functioning. The study also establishes a relationship between the online audience's attention to the call-for-action messages and the subsequent protest turnout, indicating a private-to-public shift via networked media, in which most of the diversely connected self-organized activists captured most of the attention. It finally summarizes the multidimensional nature of digital activism in defining the way social media affordance shapes the landscape of contemporary political participation.",20230501,"Fu, King-wa",Article,Academic Journal,May/Jun2023,true,Information Society,Organizational structure ; Hong Kong (China) ; Social movements ; Political participation ; Logic ; Activism,JOUR,,,0197-2243,,,,,eng,Taylor & Francis Ltd,170,158,13,39,3,10.1080/01972243.2023.2185717,,1HQ,,https://research.ebsco.com/linkprocessor/plink?id=fa08a46c-4ad6-3282-933e-7bb85fa03fa6
"Library, Information Science & Technology Abstracts",lxh,90073127,Developing a Framework to Generate Evidence of Health Outcomes From Social Media Use in Chronic Disease Management.,"Background: While there is an abundance of evidence-based practice (EBP) recommendations guiding management of various chronic diseases, evidence suggesting best practice for using social media to improve health outcomes is inadequate. The variety of social media platforms, multiple potential uses, inconsistent definitions, and paucity of rigorous studies, make it difficult to measure health outcomes reliably in chronic disease management. Most published investigations report on an earlier generation of online tools, which are not as user-centered, participatory, engaging, or collaborative, and thus may work differently for health self-management. Objective: The challenge to establish a sound evidence base for social media use in chronic disease starts with the need to define criteria and methods to generate and evaluate evidence. The authors' key objective is to develop a framework for research and practice that addresses this challenge. Methods: This paper forms part of a larger research project that presents a conceptual framework of how evidence of health outcomes can be generated from social media use, allowing social media to be utilized in chronic disease management more effectively. Using mixed methods incorporating a qualitative literature review, a survey and a pilot intervention, the research closely examines the therapeutic affordances of social media, people with chronic pain (PWCP) as a subset of chronic disease management, valid outcome measurement of patient-reported (health) outcomes (PRO), the individual needs of people living with chronic disease, and finally translation of the combined results to improve evidence-based decision making about social media use in this context. Results: Extensive review highlights various affordances of social media that may prove valuable to understanding social media's effect on individual health outcomes. However, without standardized PRO instruments, we are unable to definitively investigate these effects. The proposed framework that we offer outlines how therapeutic affordances of social media coupled with valid and reliable PRO measurement may be used to generate evidence of improvements in health outcomes, as well as guide evidence-based decision making in the future about social media use as part of chronic disease self-management. Conclusions: The results will (1) inform a framework for conducting research into health outcomes from social media use in chronic disease, as well as support translating the findings into evidence of improved health outcomes, and (2) inform a set of recommendations for evidence-based decision making about social media use as part of chronic disease self-management. These outcomes will fill a gap in the knowledge and resources available to individuals managing a chronic disease, their clinicians and other researchers in chronic disease and the field of medicine 2.0.",20130801,"Merolli, Mark ; Gray, Kathleen ; Martin-Sanchez, Fernando",Article,Academic Journal,Aug2013,true,Journal of Medical Internet Research,Social media ; Internet in medicine ; Knowledge gap theory ; Health outcome assessment ; Chronic diseases ; Self-management (Psychology) ; Management,JOUR,,,1439-4456,,,,,eng,JMIR Publications Inc.,1,1,1,15,8,10.2196/med20.2717,,DNC,,https://research.ebsco.com/linkprocessor/plink?id=dfd0666b-ba48-3b16-bdef-a209771b4dff

This is relevant for many debates in public administration today since all applications of data-driven government rest on a foundation of data. In this article, rather than focusing on specific applications, we analyze the way supra-organizational data-exchange shapes such applications and specifically automated administrative decision-making (AADM). We argue that the whole of bureaucracy that is connected through data-exchange implies the organizational separation of the collection or gathering of government data from the exchange, modification, combination and/or analysis and subsequently its (re)use in decision-making processes. To analyze the consequences of this new division of labor we further develop the concept of the infrastructure-level bureaucracy and formulate hypotheses on its consequences for data itself, organizations, and citizens. Ultimately, we argue infrastructural information flows pose challenges for democratic control and for procedural lawfulness in the constitutional state. • Many problems in contemporary digital government can be traced back to organization of information flows. • Data-exchange rather than the design of individual government applications can best explain the loss of procedural justice. • Loss of capacity for democratic control of data-exchange is best observed on the level of the information infrastructure. • We formulate hypotheses on affordances and limitations of information infrastructures for data, organizations and citizens.",20250601,"Widlak, Arjan C. ; Peeters, Rik",Article,Academic Journal,Jun2025,true,Government Information Quarterly,Information superhighway ; Internet in public administration ; Digital technology ; Procedural justice ; Public administration ; Bureaucracy,JOUR,,,0740-624X,,,,,eng,Elsevier B.V.,N.PAG,N.PAG,,42,2,10.1016/j.giq.2025.102021,,GIQ,,https://research.ebsco.com/linkprocessor/plink?id=a8e7f3ea-110d-3151-8e8c-29b0ac5bbcb4
"Library, Information Science & Technology Abstracts",lxh,162353658,How politicians adapt to new media logic. A longitudinal perspective on accommodation to user-engagement on Facebook.,"The expansion of the Internet, especially social media, enables political actors to address voters directly. However, on social media, where user interactions factor into the algorithmically determined relevance of messages and, in turn, their spread, political actors have to use communication features that entice users to interact with their messages. Taking mediatization theory as a starting point, I transferred assumptions about accommodation into the domain of social media. By conducting a content analysis of Facebook posts made by members of the Bundestag, the German Parliament, from 2010 to 2015, I analyzed whether political actors had adapted their communication to social media logic and more often used message features previously demonstrated to increase the number of interactions. Among the results, politicians had increasingly used message features that had previously raised the number of interactions, including new technical opportunities and social affordances on Facebook, whereas their use of established communication strategies had remained relatively stable. At the individual level, politicians with higher status were more likely to incorporate successful strategies, which suggests that accommodation is constrained by available resources.",20230401,"Jost, Pablo",Article,Academic Journal,Apr-Jun2023,true,Journal of Information Technology & Politics,Social media ; Content analysis ; Politicians ; Logic ; Communication strategies,JOUR,,,1933-1681,,,,,eng,Taylor & Francis Ltd,197,184,14,20,2,10.1080/19331681.2022.2076271,,3AFS,,https://research.ebsco.com/linkprocessor/plink?id=7f910ef6-006b-3148-8770-c2c5e57fdc0a
"Library, Information Science & Technology Abstracts",lxh,164178054,Peer reference and the out-of-the-building experience.,"Purpose: This article conceptualizes essential keys to the future of peer reference in academic libraries as extrapolated through the dual lenses of academic library history in the United States of America and recent experiences of a peer program with prospective and actual out-of-the-building experiences. Design/methodology/approach: A 30,000-foot historical view of the dispositions of space in academic library buildings, collections, spaces, technology and reference provision is integrated with a description of the responses and insights of a peer reference program during the program's prospective and actual out-of-the-building experiences. These components are then analyzed to extrapolate keys to peer reference provision in any learning environment. Findings: Peer reference is a natural extension of the Learning Commons model as developed in many academic libraries. To find optimal success in leveraging the benefits of peer-to-peer learning, program coordinators should keep in mind the social aspects of peer learning and intentionally articulate a framework for service delivery that best matches the modalities of providers, patrons and the information environment. In reviewing training and service practices, coordinators should be particularly on guard for any bias due to traditional reliance on the affordances of a library building and/or physical service point. Originality/value: This article founds its conclusions in regard to the future of peer reference by contextualizing the evolution and future of such programs in the wider historical context of academic library dispositions of space in support of learning.

While critics are concerned that these typically unregulated products pose risks for financially vulnerable people, many BNPL companies argue their app-based products are more responsible than other forms of credit. In this study, I use Davis' (2020) mechanisms and conditions framework of affordances and Light et al.'s (2018) walkthrough method to analyse how three popular BNPL products (Afterpay, Klarna and Zip) define responsible lending and spending. I argue these BNPL companies claim they are more responsible than credit cards because they are more inclusive and have fairer loan terms, and that these claims are made possible by the platformed nature of BNPL products. At the same time, these BNPL companies define responsible consumers as those who make their repayments on time. This redefinition of responsible consumption encourages increased spending and normalises the use of BNPL credit for that consumption. These products, which challenge traditional regulatory responses to consumer credit, are disproportionately used by lower-income families, who are increasingly reliant on credit for everyday purchases.",20230401,"Aalders, Rachel",Article,Academic Journal,Apr2023,true,"Information, Communication & Society",Mobile apps ; Consumers ; Poor people ; Consumer behavior ; Consumer credit ; Credit cards,JOUR,,,1369-118X,,,,,eng,Taylor & Francis Ltd,956,941,16,26,5,10.1080/1369118X.2022.2161830,,5BA,,https://research.ebsco.com/linkprocessor/plink?id=aa4b3a00-51a7-3f3c-8d51-38dd90918dd5
"Library, Information Science & Technology Abstracts",lxh,162238800,A grounded theory of information exclusion and information inclusion: framing the information experience of people seeking asylum.,"Purpose: This paper discusses an original theory of information exclusion and information inclusion, which explains how information interactions can be structured in ways that either exclude or include people seeking asylum. Design/methodology/approach: This theory was developed through an ethnographic study of the information experience of people seeking asylum in the United Kingdom. Fieldwork involved participant observations, participatory research workshops and semi-structured interviews, analysed using a constructivist grounded theory approach. Findings: People seeking asylum are confronted with two main information environments: the asylum system and the local third sector. Each environment frames contrasting information access, sharing and literacy practice modalities: the former produces information deprivation, information sharing agency denial and a fracturing information literacy practice; the latter facilitates multiple information affordances, information sharing agency promotion, and both local and heritage information literacy practice promotion. Our theory of information exclusion and information inclusion describes how through these modalities, an information environment can either promote or preclude inclusion. Originality/value: Previous information studies of migration tend to conceptualise social ex/inclusion as a linear journey. Our theory originally frames this as a non-straightforward and conflicting process, allowing to better understand the experience of people who are not simply either socially excluded or included, but may experience both states depending on context. It also shows that exclusion is not a matter of fact and is not fundamental to asylum systems: it is produced by specific policies and procedures and can therefore be changed. Thus, this theory provides conceptual tools for researchers to investigate the information experience of individuals moving between conflicting information practices, and for civil society actors and policymakers to document exclusionary information practices and design inclusive ones.",20230301,"Le Louvier, Kahina ; Innocenti, Perla",Article,Academic Journal,2023,true,Journal of Documentation,Information theory ; Information literacy ; Access to information ; United Kingdom ; Political refugees ; Grounded theory ; Social integration,JOUR,,,0022-0418,,,,,eng,Emerald Publishing Limited,486,468,19,79,2,10.1108/JD-04-2022-0077,,GRF,,https://research.ebsco.com/linkprocessor/plink?id=6a4215c5-c532-3162-9585-8f38a0eb77a0
"Library, Information Science & Technology Abstracts",lxh,162754425,The materialities and embodiments of mundane software: exploring how apps come to matter in everyday life.,"Purpose: In this article, the authors aim to explore mobile apps as both mundane and extraordinary digital media artefacts, designed and promoted to improve or solve problems in people's lives. Drawing on their ""App Stories"" project, the authors elaborate on how the efficiencies and affordances credited to technologies emerge and are performed through the specific embodied practices that constitute human–app relationships. Design/methodology/approach: The project involved short written accounts in an online survey from 200 Australian adults about apps. Analysis was conducted from a sociomaterial perspective, surfacing the emotional and embodied responses to and engagements with the apps; the relational connections described between people and their apps or with other people or objects; and what the apps enabled or motivated people to do. Findings: Findings point to three salient concerns about apps: (1) the need for efficiency; (2) the importance and complexity of human relationships and maintaining these connections; and (3) the complex relationships people have with their bodies. These concerns are expressed through themes that reflect how everyday efficiencies are produced through human–app entanglements; apps as relational agents; apps' ability to know and understand users; and future app imaginaries. Originality/value: This project explores the affective and embodied dimensions of app use and thinks through the tensions between the extraordinary and mundane dimensions of contemporary techno-social landscapes, reflecting on how apps ""matter"" in everyday life.

Design/methodology/approach: The research was conducted as an inductive, qualitative study in the field of higher education in Finland. The data were collected using semi-structured interviews of 34 managers in two higher education institutions and analyzed using an inductive and interpretive analysis method. Findings: The findings demonstrate that the knowledge-related challenges and opportunities during the remote work period of the COVID-19 pandemic in Finnish higher education institutions can be conceptualized as tensions involved in knowledge codification, knowledge silos and creating new knowledge. The study contributes to research by presenting a framework for managing knowledge-related tensions in remote work arrangements to benefit remote and hybrid work in knowledge-intensive organizations. Practical implications: This paper increases the understanding of the tensions in remote work arrangements; the results can help managers understand the challenges and opportunities of remote knowledge work concerning their organization and thereby assist them in management and decision-making in complex operational environments. Originality/value: This study adopted the little-used perspective of tensions to examine knowledge management issues.

Selecting appropriate outcomes, instruments for measuring outcomes, and assessment methods are crucial for ensuring that interventions are evaluated effectively and with a high level of quality. Objective: We aimed to identify the types of outcomes, outcome measurement instruments, and assessment methods used to assess the clinical, user experience, and technical outcomes in studies that evaluated the effectiveness of CA interventions for mental health. Methods: We undertook a scoping review of the relevant literature to review the types of outcomes, outcome measurement instruments, and assessment methods in studies that evaluated the effectiveness of CA interventions for mental health. We performed a comprehensive search of electronic databases, including PubMed, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, Embase (Ovid), PsychINFO, and Web of Science, as well as Google Scholar and Google. We included experimental studies evaluating CA mental health interventions. The screening and data extraction were performed independently by 2 review authors in parallel. Descriptive and thematic analyses of the findings were performed. Results: We included 32 studies that targeted the promotion of mental well-being (17/32, 53%) and the treatment and monitoring of mental health symptoms (21/32, 66%). The studies reported 203 outcome measurement instruments used to measure clinical outcomes (123/203, 60.6%), user experience outcomes (75/203, 36.9%), technical outcomes (2/203, 1.0%), and other outcomes (3/203, 1.5%). Most of the outcome measurement instruments were used in only 1 study (150/203, 73.9%) and were self-reported questionnaires (170/203, 83.7%), and most were delivered electronically via survey platforms (61/203, 30.0%). No validity evidence was cited for more than half of the outcome measurement instruments (107/203, 52.7%), which were largely created or adapted for the study in which they were used (95/107, 88.8%). Conclusions: The diversity of outcomes and the choice of outcome measurement instruments employed in studies on CAs for mental health point to the need for an established minimum core outcome set and greater use of validated instruments. Future studies should also capitalize on the affordances made available by CAs and smartphones to streamline the evaluation and reduce participants' input burden inherent to self-reporting.",20230101,"Jabir, Ahmad Ishqi ; Martinengo, Laura ; Lin, Xiaowen ; Torous, John ; Subramaniam, Mythily ; Tudor Car, Lorainne",Article,Academic Journal,2023,true,Journal of Medical Internet Research,Data integrity ; Mental health services ; Mental illness ; Mobile health ; Measuring instruments,JOUR,,,1439-4456,,,,,eng,JMIR Publications Inc.,17,1,17,25,1,10.2196/44548,,DNC,,https://research.ebsco.com/linkprocessor/plink?id=66a42366-57ba-3a7f-84c1-c667747c09ad
"Library, Information Science & Technology Abstracts",lxh,161480663,Path-Based Recommender System for Learning Activities Using Knowledge Graphs.,"Recommender systems can offer a fertile ground in e-learning software, since they can assist users by presenting them with learning material in which they can be more interested, based on their preferences. To this end, in this paper, we present a new method for a knowledge-graph-based, path-based recommender system for learning activities. The suggested approach makes better learning activity recommendations by using connections between people and/or products. By pre-defining meta-paths or automatically mining connective patterns, our method uses the student-learning activity graph to find path-level commonalities for learning activities. The path-based approach can provide an explanation for the result as well. Our methodology is used in an intelligent tutoring system with Java programming as the domain being taught. The system keeps track of user behavior and can recommend learning activities to students using a knowledge-graph-based recommender system. Numerous metadata, such as kind, complexity, and number of questions, are used to describe each activity. The system has been evaluated with promising results that highlight the effectiveness of the path-based recommendations for learning activities, while preserving the pedagogical affordance.",20230101,"Troussas, Christos ; Krouska, Akrivi",Article,Academic Journal,Jan2023,true,Information,Recommender systems ; Educational technology ; Java (Indonesia) ; Knowledge graphs ; Intelligent tutoring systems ; Instructional systems,JOUR,,,2078-2489,,,,,eng,MDPI,,9,,14,1,10.3390/info14010009,,B74H,,https://research.ebsco.com/linkprocessor/plink?id=54ffc758-f840-34d5-83c9-28659529f4b3
"Library, Information Science & Technology Abstracts",lxh,174173038,Determinants of blockchain technology application in primary healthcare delivery: An integrated best-worst approach.,"Primary healthcare (PHC) has become a concern in most resource constraint economies particularly in the global south where meeting this important economic need has become a burden. Given this, blockchain technology (BT), a promising transformation in contemporary service delivery, has become an alternative for service-oriented institutions to meet their desired goals. In primary healthcare, BT has been utilised to lessen the burden on medical supply chain and data management. Nonetheless, the technology seems to be a preserve of the developed economies. In the global south, not only has the complexities of the technology hindered the implementation of the technology but the understanding of its affordances has also been nascent. This study extends Task-technology fit model with the perceived e-readiness model. Drawing on the best-worst method, this paper investigates PHC managers' decision to embrace BT for PHC delivery in Ghana. The study finds that, in order of relevance, task-technology, infrastructure and individual characteristics are the main drivers of BT adoption and implementation. The study proposes the implementation of various strategies relevant to ensuring a sustainable BT for the management of PHC in resource constraint economies.",20230101,"Egala, Sulemana Bankuoru ; Liang, Decui ; Darko, Adjei Peter ; Boateng, Dorcas ; Yahaya, Haleem",Article,Academic Journal,2023,true,Cogent Engineering,Ghana ; Blockchains ; Medical care ; Supply chain management ; Developing countries ; Medical supplies ; Determinants (Mathematics),JOUR,,,2331-1916,,,,,eng,Taylor & Francis Ltd,24,1,24,10,1,10.1080/23311916.2023.2202032,,JX4Q,,https://research.ebsco.com/linkprocessor/plink?id=e01a723a-9ca1-3c51-a7a6-b0fc81a2af55

Using a telepresence robot to engage in face time at the office.","Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to study the impact of mobile robotic telepresence systems on face time – which refers to people ""seeing and being seen"" – and analyse whether they allow overcoming the challenges associated with telecommuting. Design/methodology/approach: This research is based on a qualitative methodology in two French high-tech companies using interviews to better understand how the use of a telepresence robot is experienced by teleworkers, co-workers and their managers. Findings: The results demonstrate that telepresence robots do offset the absence of teleworkers by allowing them to engage in face time, even remotely. It shows how the telepresence robot's affordances impact the different dimensions of face time and examine the processes through which teleworkers and co-workers anthropomorphize the robot and manage their privacy needs.

"Library, Information Science & Technology Abstracts",lxh,155181533,Between analogue and digital: A critical exploration of strategic social media use in Greek election campaigns.,"Amidst the burgeoning literature on the use social media in electoral politics, there are still relatively few studies that seek to understand developments in digital campaigning from the inside. Drawing on 9 semi-structured interviews with Greek political communication consultants, we address this gap. Theoretically, we draw from Kreiss, Lawrence, & McGregor' s analytical framework that seeks to account for the ways that campaigns perceive their candidates in relation to audiences, affordances, and genres of different social media platforms, as well as the timing of the electoral cycle, in order to effectively study strategic social media communication. Our findings show that Greek campaigns are embracing many social media but still have a relatively rudimentary understanding of the affordances of different platforms and their communicative cultures. Where campaign communication strategies are shaped by politicians, they typically favor one platform as a channel for all their content. Our findings demonstrate that different media systems and political cultures impact considerably on the adoption of digital communication strategiesand can be quite far from the highly professional and sophisticated American model.

"Library, Information Science & Technology Abstracts",lxh,154497148,Understanding attitudes towards social media segregation: spatial metaphors in the discussion of Twitter blocklists.,"Blocking other users is a common act on Twitter but one which is underexplored from a scholarly perspective, particularly the analysis of mass blocklists. Although traditionally associated with harassment, blocklists are increasingly engaged to create individualised environments that align with users' personal convictions and exclude apparent transgressors. This study uses a pro-choice blocklist (Repeal Shield) created during the 2018 Irish abortion referendum campaign to explore how users interpret these altered boundaries and blocklists' influence on the Twitter landscape. A metaphor analysis of more than 2,000 tweets discussing the blocklist highlights the dominant concepts in how users visualise Twitter as both a personal space and a battlefield, in which mental health is a key factor. By drawing on discussions of spatiality, agency, gender and online interactions, we can see how these blocking affordances allow users to exist in spaces in which they construct their own parameters to feel safer, raising questions about how harm, health and risk are understood. The article explores how users make sense of conflicting images like 'safe spaces' or 'echo chambers', highlighting the apparent policing role held by blocklists. Users are negotiating the type of civic space in which they want to exist as norms of engagement versus avoidance collide; although digital spaces have always accommodated fragmented interests, the technological affordances of blocklists provide more rigid boundaries, highlighting how the evolving architecture of social media allows users to redefine the parameters of their own online spaces.",20220101,"Wheatley, Dawn ; Vatnoey, Eirik",Article,Academic Journal,Jan 2022,true,"Information, Communication & Society",Virtual communities ; Social media ; X Corp. ; Social attitudes ; Personal space ; Metaphor ; Mental health,JOUR,,,1369-118X,,,,,eng,Taylor & Francis Ltd,16,1,16,25,1,10.1080/1369118X.2020.1749696,,5BA,,https://research.ebsco.com/linkprocessor/plink?id=4de8820e-d8e8-30c6-9e83-62f2c11cbac4

However, little is known about how employees use these new capabilities, thus leading to performance variation. Drawing on a rich dataset from an ESM platform built in a Chinese high-tech company, this paper uses Exponential Random Graph Models (ERGMs) to examine how employees build their social networks on ESM platforms with the visibility affordance of ESM. The results reveal that (1) employees' networking behaviours on ESM platforms are limited by formal organisational boundaries such as department and hierarchical positions, and they tend to reproduce their working structures rather than to build new ties across horizontal and vertical boundaries enabled by ESM; (2) employees' networking behaviours are more likely to be influenced by their positions in formal hierarchy than by their informal hierarchies derived from their interactions on ESM; and (3) employees use ESM to reinforce their natural networking tendencies, including preferential attachment, closure and homophily. These findings extend our understandings of employees' social networking behaviours on ESM platforms and provide insights for managers to make better decisions on the design and implementation of ESM thus to achieve the expected benefits.",20221215,"Miao, Rui ; He, Xiao ; Huang, Lihua",Article,Academic Journal,Dec2022,true,Behaviour & Information Technology,Problem solving ; Social media ; Employee psychology ; Social networks ; Job involvement ; Interprofessional relations ; Social classes ; Interpersonal relations ; Social skills ; Statistical models ; Corporate culture,JOUR,,,0144-929X,,,,,eng,Taylor & Francis Ltd,3590,3574,17,41,16,10.1080/0144929X.2021.2004228,,B6Q,,https://research.ebsco.com/linkprocessor/plink?id=b91f2534-604e-3593-a60f-b21cc1187c13
"Library, Information Science & Technology Abstracts",lxh,160709421,Metrics and epistemic injustice.,"Purpose: This paper examines the socio-political affordances of metrics in research evaluation and the consequences of epistemic injustice in research practices and recorded knowledge. Design/methodology/approach: First, the use of metrics is examined as a mechanism that promotes competition and social acceleration. Second, it is argued that the use of metrics in a competitive research culture reproduces systemic inequalities and leads to epistemic injustice. The conceptual analysis draws on works of Hartmut Rosa and Miranda Fricker, amongst others. Findings: The use of metrics is largely driven by competition such as university rankings and league tables. Not only that metrics are not designed to enrich academic and research culture, they also suppress the visibility and credibility of works by minorities. As such, metrics perpetuate epistemic injustice in knowledge practices; at the same time, the reliability of metrics for bibliometric and scientometric studies is put into question. Social implications: As metrics leverage who can speak and who will be heard, epistemic injustice is reflected in recorded knowledge and what we consider to be information. Originality/value: This paper contributes to the discussion of metrics beyond bibliometric studies and research evaluation. It argues that metrics-induced competition is antithetical to equality and diversity in research practices.",20221201,"Ma, Lai",Article,Academic Journal,2022,true,Journal of Documentation,Bibliometrics ; Social impact ; Research evaluation ; University research ; University rankings,JOUR,,,0022-0418,,,,,eng,Emerald Publishing Limited,404,392,13,78,7,10.1108/JD-12-2021-0240,,GRF,,https://research.ebsco.com/linkprocessor/plink?id=1faa077a-5f7a-3e13-bd0f-d618eb0dff4d

This paper reports findings from teacher interviews conducted with K‐12 public school teachers, exploring how digital access and use gaps in communities reflect wider digital and social inequalities as schools fulfilled emergency remote teaching mandates, becoming swept up into e‐learning technology expansion trends propelled by mandates, and unfettered corporate edtech. Results show persistence of home and school level digital affordance gaps as hindrances to pandemic pedagogy. We build upon theory of the digital divide, and crisis and critical informatics literature considering how critical approaches to the study of socio‐technical systems research can inform these understandings, providing insights into how localized digital inequities contribute to broader digital inequality and social inequality, in the educative processes expected of public education in democratic societies.

"Library, Information Science & Technology Abstracts",lxh,158861579,View analysis of personal information leakage and privacy protection in big data era—based on Q method.,"Purpose: In the era of big data, people are more likely to pay attention to privacy protection with facing the risk of personal information leakage while enjoying the convenience brought by big data technology. Furthermore, people's views on personal information leakage and privacy protection are varied, playing an important role in the legal process of personal information protection. Therefore, this paper aims to propose a semi-qualitative method based framework to reveal the subjective patterns about information leakage and privacy protection and further provide practical implications for interested party. Design/methodology/approach: Q method is a semi-qualitative methodology which is designed for identifying typologies of perspectives. In order to have a comprehensive understanding of users' viewpoints, this study incorporates LDA & TextRank method and other information extraction technologies to capture the statements from large-scale literature, app reviews, typical cases and survey interviews, which could be regarded as the resource of the viewpoints. Findings: By adopting the Q method that aims for studying subjective thought patterns to identify users' potential views, the authors have identified three categories of stakeholders' subjectivities: macro-policy sensitive, trade-offs and personal information sensitive, each of which perceives different risk and affordance of information leakage and importance and urgency of privacy protection. All of the subjectivities of the respondents reflect the awareness of the issue of information leakage, that is, the interested parties like social network sites are unable to protect their full personal information, while reflecting varied resistance and susceptibility of disclosing personal information for big data technology applications. Originality/value: The findings of this study provide an overview of the subjective patterns on the information leakage issue. Being the first to incorporate the Q method to study the views of personal information leakage and privacy protection, the research not only broadens the application field of the Q method but also enriches the research methods for personal information protection.

These forms include seemingly non-organized online groups, which can be easily dismissed as informal chatter. Building on communicative theories of organizing and Luhmann's Theory of Social Systems, we explore the communicative organizationality of a Facebook group related to urban planning. By analyzing private chat logs of the group administrators, we explore the group's organizationality and the ways in which organizational and interactional communication become intertwined to produce and curate digital political discussions. Our findings illustrate how technological affordances built for moderation also support the strategic organization of discussions to orchestrate political talk.

"Library, Information Science & Technology Abstracts",lxh,149051318,"Transforming communication, social media, counter-hegemony and the struggle for the soul of Nigeria.","The emergence of information communication technologies has transformed communication in Nigeria. The mass media once regarded as the most vocal and vibrant press in Africa is losing public trust as people easily source for critical information from social media instead of the media due to their patrimonial relationship with the state. The potentials of these information communication technologies in holding government accountable and enhancing journalism practice has endangers the state. Consequently, attempts by the state at regulating social media and the mass media through draconian bills such as protection from internet falsehood and manipulation bill of 2019, and the National Communication for the prohibition of Hate Speech bill 2019. Using Habermas notion of the public sphere coupled with semi-structured interviews with 12 media practitioners, this paper examines ways in which such regulatory frameworks have impacted on both the media and democratic cultures of the Nigerian state. The paper argues that social media and its convergence in the newsroom has expounded the democratic culture due to its affordances of speedy and accountability. However, the potentials of social media and its affordance has been misused. Consequently, the contestation between the state, public and media on how social media and its convergence in the newsroom can be effectively regulated.

"Library, Information Science & Technology Abstracts",lxh,183060425,Cripping Conferences: An Autoethnographic Exploration of Disability in Academia.,"This paper employs autoethnography to expose the conference experiences of disabled scholars within the academic and library fields, highlighting the systemic barriers found in these professional settings. In integrating personal narratives with theoretical insights, this study highlights how rigid conference spaces and norms do not accommodate disabled bodyminds, which hinders professional development, and highlights the need for systemic changes. The barriers found include the mental load of navigating inaccessible spaces, the extra financial costs required for participation, and interference between the clock time of conferences and the crip time of disabled bodyminds. While conferences provide challenges, we also find them to be a place for crip connections, as seen in the authors' friendship that provides both emotional and professional support. This paper concludes with theoretical implications for making conferences more accessible and the disentanglement of libraries and academia from their ideas of productivity and ideal workers. By Rhys Dreeszen Bowman and Leah T. Dudak Introduction Positionality Rhys Dreeszen Bowman (they/them) is a white, queer, nonbinary Ph.D. candidate at the University of South Carolina. They are a former high school librarian in rural New England. They have a middle-class family background and are also privileged in their whiteness, access to education, and status as a citizen. Rhys is physically disabled and chronically and mentally ill. Rhys is sometimes invisibly disabled and sometimes uses a mobility aid. They often can conceal their disability and pass as nondisabled, which reduces the ableism they experience. Passing as nondisabled also affects their ability to meet their accessibility needs and navigate the world. Leah T. Dudak (she/her) is a white, cis, female, fat, librarian, and Ph.D. student at Syracuse University. She is disabled with diagnoses of fibromyalgia, dysgraphia, anxiety, and depression. She sees her body as disabled, but her disabilities are often invisible, so people cannot outwardly see them unless she uses a mobility aid or discloses her disability. Meanwhile, her body also carries immense privilege of sometimes passing as nondisabled, as well as the privileges of race, sexuality/gender, education, and socioeconomic status. Note on language We use the term bodymind because we consider the physical body and mind inseparable and to act in concert (Price, 2011). We resist the Western assumption that the body and mind are distinct and the privileging of the mind over the body (Clare, 2017). We also use the term crip to move our conversation outside the insular walls of academia and link our work to disability justice activists and the tangible lives of disabled people, moving beyond a disability rights movement that is primarily concerned with helping white men integrate into mainstream society as productive citizens (Hamraie, 2017). We align ourselves instead with the disability justice revolution, built by queer and trans Black, Indigenous, people of color (BIPOC) activists, that fights for the liberation of all sick/unwell/mad/neurodivergent/crip bodyminds. Literature Review We add to the tradition of disability scholars attuning to the role of disability and resistance in academia. In Activist Affordances, Dokumaci (2023) uses visual ethnography to chronicle the lives of invisibly disabled people related to arthritis and other inflammatory diseases. Dokumaci attunes to what she calls ""unnoticed choreographies,"" or the everyday actions disabled people take to move through the world (p. 2). The author calls activist affordances the ""performative microacts/arts through which disabled people enact and bring into being the worlds that are not already available to them, the worlds they need and which to dwell in"" (pp. 2-3). She posits that disabled futures already exist and activist affordances are ""outposts"" of these worlds. We draw on Dokumaci's work to frame our disabled resistance within academia and the possibilities we find for disabled futurities. In The Undercommons: Fugitive Planning & Black Study, Harney and Moten (2013) examine how institutions such as the university impede our ability to empathize and our capacity to love. They call the undercommons a ""maroon community"" of teachers and students that ""refuse to ask for recognition and instead want to take apart, dismantle, tear down the structure that, right now, limits our ability to find each other, to see beyond it and to access the places we know lie beyond its walls"" (p. 6). They argue that the university is designed to uphold capitalism, and the university creates a free labor source to benefit the State. We borrow from Harney and Moten's understanding of the university as an agent of capitalism, extending their argument to the way the neoliberal values of academia limit and harm disabled academics. Additionally, this work is adding to already existing literature around the inaccessibility of conferences such as Manwiller's (2019) article highlighting how conferences can often be the hardest part of being an academic and harder than any other professional experience. In her follow-up critique of the 2021 ACRL conference, she writes: ""At the time, I thought it was my responsibility to adapt to the conference setting if I wanted to be professionally active"" (2021). Finally, she questions why library organizations act and conduct business as if disabled workers do not exist. Below, we expand upon Manwiller's articles and discuss this tension between participating in a conference and creating our own space, but also demanding to be accommodated in the rest of this work. Price (2011) challenges the academic assumption that disability affects the body while the mind remains untouched by illness. She pushes understandings of disability and education practices to include mental disability. Price challenges readers to reconsider ableist academic values such as productivity and independence and how they damage disabled people. Andersen (2024) uses autoethnography to interrogate how disability impacts the author's experience as a librarian. Anderson notes how writing in the field of Library and Information Science (LIS) focuses on how libraries can serve patrons with disabilities, ignoring the possibility that librarians could themselves be disabled. Theoretical framework Autoethnography as a method Autoethnography empowers us to share our experience and, in doing so, speak back to the silence that frames illness as private and unspeakable, which allows us to open a conversation about what it means to participate in librarianship and academia in bodyminds that are devalued and excluded. We argue that autoethnography is a crip methodology. When one's own bodymind becomes the site of research, there is no need to travel or schedule to conduct interviews, which can tax the body and ignores our need for sudden rest. Conducting research on ourselves allows us to research as it suits our bodies. We work when we are able and rest when we need to. Crip autoethnography also values disabled stories as knowledge that is worthy of study (Richards, 2008; Kasnitz, 2020). We position ourselves as both subjects and objects, and through storytelling construct knowledge (Ellis, 2004). In this, we are not creating universal truths but sharing just as valid individual ones, which can still create disruption and push change. We use autoethnography to connect the personal and political and ""show how stories become the change we want to see in the world"" (Holman Jones & Harris, 2019). Our research addresses the injustice within librarianship, academia, and within our own research (Madison, 2012). By analyzing our stories, we advance knowledge and offer possibilities for new practices. Using Kafer (2013) as a model, we tie crip autoethnography to queer autoethnography to focus on subjugated knowledges. Queering autoethnography speaks truth to power and in ""that speaking enacts new worlds. Not just records them"" (Holman Jones & Harris, 2019, p. 64). Additionally, oftentimes, disability and chronic illness are written about from a medicalized point of view to inform caregivers or medical professionals. However, in this, the voice of the patient/client/disabled individual is often ignored (Piepzna-Samarasinha, 2018). As such, disabled bodies become something that is worked on, rather than an active participant in care. Autoethnography allows us to say in our own words our experiences, needs, wants, and desires without our stories then being filtered through a medicalized lens. This filtering erases our voice, but through autoethnography, we fully claim it, appreciate ourselves as experts, and analyze it in our own terms (Kasnitz, 2020; Richards, 2008). While many critics of autoethnography may see this closeness as a flaw, we see it as a reclamation of voice and story. We also acknowledge that there is no one disabled experience, which is why we are writing together in some sections (such as this one) and also separately, even though we are both academics who share a discipline. We are both insiders and outsiders to each other (Richards, 2008). In using autoethnography, we give voice to our similarities and differences, which allows us to open a world of possibilities. Crip time We frame our experience of conference attendance through the lens of crip time, popularized by Alison Kafer (2013) in her book Feminist Queer Crip, who uses crip time to discuss the way time operates differently for queer and disabled people. Disabled people move at a slower (or faster) space than normative society and might need more time to complete tasks or may be late to meetings due to navigating an inaccessible physical world. It is in direct conflict with normative <sup>[1]</sup> or clock time. We lose time to doctor visits, surgeries, and days spent in bed. Simple acts often result in the need for time to rest and recover. The adage that everyone has the same 24 hours crumbles upon an examination of disabled relationships with time. Kuppers calls crip time a ""temporal shifting"" (2014, paragraph 2), a way we slip out of place with clock time or the time at which normative society functions. Clock time is the time zone of neoliberal capitalism, while crip time belongs to the land of the ill. Samuels (2017) writes that crip time is time travel. Disability and illness have the power to extract us from linear, progressive time with its normative life stages and cast us into a wormhole of backward and forward acceleration, jerky stops and starts, tedious intervals and abrupt endings (paragraph 5).",20250101,"Bowman, Rhys Dreeszen ; Dudak, Leah T.",Article,Academic Journal,Jan2025,true,In the Library with the Lead Pipe,Autoethnography ; Disabilities ; Professional education,JOUR,,,1944-6195,,,,,eng,In the Library with the Lead Pipe,N.PAG,N.PAG,,,,,,8VW3,,https://research.ebsco.com/linkprocessor/plink?id=29a3d58a-18ec-383b-bd4a-09ddebd99db5

Especially, we describe the techniques used to perform personal authenticity and cultural competence.

Master data management (MDM) is a data management practice, which attempts to increase data quality and data use across business processes throughout the organization. This paper observes how data ownership, responsibilities, and roles change during MDM development. The metaphor of imbrication was used as a theoretical lens to identify the factors that influenced the change, and to analyze the change as a result of the intertwined social and material factors. We derive ethnographical data from two MDM projects in a municipality over a time period of 32 months, and describe how data ownership and data governance roles and responsibilities were perceived, and how they evolved during the development. As a result, MDM data ownership is emphasized, and has distinct features in relation to roles and responsibilities.

"Library, Information Science & Technology Abstracts",lxh,135290332,The rise of motivational information systems: A review of gamification research.,"Abstract Today, our reality and lives are increasingly game-like, not only because games have become a pervasive part of our lives, but also because activities, systems and services are increasingly gamified. Gamification refers to designing information systems to afford similar experiences and motivations as games do, and consequently, attempting to affect user behavior. In recent years, popularity of gamification has skyrocketed and manifested in growing numbers of gamified applications, as well as a rapidly increasing amount of research. However, this vein of research has mainly advanced without an agenda, theoretical guidance or a clear picture of the field. To make the picture more coherent, we provide a comprehensive review of the gamification research (N = 819 studies) and analyze the research models and results in empirical studies on gamification. While the results in general lean towards positive findings about the effectiveness of gamification, the amount of mixed results is remarkable. Furthermore, education, health and crowdsourcing as well as points, badges and leaderboards persist as the most common contexts and ways of implementing gamification. Concurrently, gamification research still lacks coherence in research models, and a consistency in the variables and theoretical foundations. As a final contribution of the review, we provide a comprehensive discussion, consisting of 15 future research trajectories, on future agenda for the growing vein of literature on gamification and gameful systems within the information system science field.",20190401,"Koivisto, Jonna ; Hamari, Juho",Article,Academic Journal,Apr2019,true,International Journal of Information Management,Research ; Gamification,JOUR,,,0268-4012,,,,,eng,Elsevier B.V.,210,191,20,45,,10.1016/j.ijinfomgt.2018.10.013,,1LL,,https://research.ebsco.com/linkprocessor/plink?id=e14c7bc5-9cfa-36d7-bbd3-149bbc58e563

The impact of working in online environments and using video and other communication channels on students' learning experiences is still not fully understood. The present study addresses this question by drawing on students' written reflections and interviews from the Finnish higher education context collected during the COVID-19 pandemic. It uses the qualitative method of thematic analysis to investigate students' experiences of interacting in synchronous sessions and their perceptions on (dis)engagement. The analysis shows the importance of versatile teaching methods and enhanced participation, the use of web cameras and anti-distraction strategies for engagement. In contrast, some aspects, such as communication issues, camera-induced self-awareness, and distractions from one's physical and digital surroundings, pertain to disengagement. The study contributes to a better understanding of the common challenges and affordances of distributed learning environments on student engagement, but also shows individual differences in how these are perceived. The findings have implications for online teaching pedagogy and course design in general and higher education in particular.",20220701,"Oittinen, Tuire ; Háhn, J. ; Räisänen, T.",Article,Academic Journal,2022,true,Digital Culture & Education,COVID-19 pandemic ; College students,JOUR,,,1836-8301,,,,,eng,Digital Culture & Education,34,16,19,14,3,,,FDOX,,https://research.ebsco.com/linkprocessor/plink?id=1ce723e2-38aa-3fbd-a9cb-3f77a43ee826
"Library, Information Science & Technology Abstracts",lxh,158894652,Understanding radio art reception.,"Radio art is understood as radio made by artists. The term is typically applied to sound-based artifacts produced and broadcast by means of the creative use of radio media affordances, infrastructure, and technologies. Radio art is known as any sound work conceived to expand the creative and aesthetic possibilities of the medium through the use of the elements of radiophonic language (voice, words, music, sound effects, and silence) with the intention to produce aesthetic messages and to move radio listeners. This study introduces radio art reception as a subject of scientific scrutiny. It proposes a model of radio art processing that includes involvement, art reception, and positive emotions as predictors of the willingness to listen to such works. After listening to each of two pieces of radio art, 126 Singaporean undergraduate communication students (M<sub>Age</sub> = 22.7, SD = 1.7) completed a questionnaire measuring involvement, art reception, perceived emotions, and willingness to listen to another radio art feature. The main results confirm our model of radio art reception: involvement predicts the audience’s cognitive stimulation generated by radio art, their artistic evaluation, and the positive attraction experienced by audiences towards them. The positive emotions experienced during consumption have a direct effect on the attraction towards radio art. Moreover, the specific radio art content affects the audiences’ responses. These results allow us to understand psychological responses to sound art. The hope is to attract the attention of communication and art researchers and invite them to deepen the existing knowledge about artistic sound through empirical studies, since debates about radio art and sound works are almost lacking from scientific literature.",20220701,"Soto-Sanfiel, María T. ; Freeman, Bradley C. ; Angulo-Brunet, Ariadna",Article,Academic Journal,jul-ago2022,true,El Profesional de la Información,Aesthetics of art ; Sound art ; Themes in art ; Artistic creation ; Scientific literature ; Audience response ; Radio audiences ; Emotions ; Listening comprehension,JOUR,,,1386-6710,,,,,eng,EPI SCP,13,1,13,31,4,10.3145/epi.2022.jul.16,,EI0,,https://research.ebsco.com/linkprocessor/plink?id=2642c390-fa64-346d-8e68-30edaa73274d
"Library, Information Science & Technology Abstracts",lxh,158078455,From shoeboxes to shared spaces: participatory cultural heritage via digital platforms.,"Moves towards a post-custodial, participatory paradigm have been well-documented in the cultural heritage sector. The capacity for individuals to contribute to community archives is significant, given their emphasis on representing the experiences of those hidden, ignored, underrepresented or misrepresented by mainstream cultural heritage institutions. Digital platforms offer affordances that can be utilised to encourage the collecting, curating and sharing of collective memories. While there are analyses of individual projects in using technologies for these aims, collective analyses of such practices remain scant in the scholarly literature. This research examines a purposefully selected sample of projects that feature participatory cultural heritage practices and offers a collective analysis of their objectives and motivations, the varying levels of engagement, the technology-mediated participatory activities supported, and how the projects are resourced and sustained. The findings indicate that the enabling of participation through digital platforms vary in nature, depth and extent, and a spectrum approach can be a useful way of conceptualising and envisaging the various levels of engagement in participatory cultural heritage. The collective analysis shows that when projects are designed with a human-centred computing focus and a community-oriented foundation, there is evidence of deeper engagement and sustained participation.",20220701,"Liew, Chern Li ; Goulding, Anne ; Nichol, Max",Article,Academic Journal,Jul2022,true,"Information, Communication & Society",Cultural property ; Digital technology ; Collective memory,JOUR,,,1369-118X,,,,,eng,Taylor & Francis Ltd,1310,1293,18,25,9,10.1080/1369118X.2020.1851391,,5BA,,https://research.ebsco.com/linkprocessor/plink?id=15c2ef1b-4094-3412-89cf-e8eb6bd89aac

An online OER was designed to address the domains of access, evaluation and communication of IL guided by the notion of instructional scaffolding and self-regulated learning. Participants were randomly placed into one of six different OER conditions: (a) full version with all instructional elements, (b) lean version, (c) version without tooltip text, (d) version without embedded practice questions, (e) version without learning objectives and (f) version without summaries. There were no significant differences found across the six conditions on the dependent measures. Participants averaged 58% for IL achievement, performing slightly better in the domain of access versus evaluate and communicate. Limitations include a controlled laboratory setting where participants were not necessarily motivated to complete the study tasks at a high level of achievement. Future research can explore more ecologically valid environments where learners might be more motivated, along with more rigorous intervention and assessment construction.

"Library, Information Science & Technology Abstracts",lxh,157176739,SRSLY?? A typology of online ironic markers.,"Social media constitute a fertile though challenging arena for the use of ironic humor. A combination of facilitating and hindering factors turns the production and identification of irony in this sphere into a complex venture, positioning it as a powerful tool in consolidating group boundaries. The main aims of this paper are to identify the markers of ironic humor on social media and to explicate their workings within the dynamics of digital interactions. Existing literature about ironic markers addresses mostly face-to-face and mass-mediated interactions, while there is a gap in our understanding of the production and interpretation of irony in the unique communicative conditions of social media. An analysis of a bilingual corpus of successful and failed ironic utterances extracted from five social network sites yielded a novel typology of five ironic markers: platform, participants, style, intra-textual content, and contextual knowledge. These markers both resemble and deviate from features of irony in non-digital settings. Media affordances often allow access to necessary complementary information, yet such forensic activity is only accessible to active users, who recognize the need for further investigation of the meant. Hence, using certain types of ironic markers forms utterances that are decipherable to some audiences but opaque to others. In this sense, the marking of digital irony and its decoding both rely on group boundaries and play a central role in their delineation. We conclude by evaluating the roles of this new regime of ironic markers in processes of boundary work.",20220601,"Gal, Noam ; Kampf, Zohar ; Shifman, Limor",Article,Academic Journal,Jun2022,true,"Information, Communication & Society",Online social networks ; Factors of production,JOUR,,,1369-118X,,,,,eng,Taylor & Francis Ltd,1009,992,18,25,7,10.1080/1369118X.2020.1814380,,5BA,,https://research.ebsco.com/linkprocessor/plink?id=c4698011-1ec0-393d-b414-ccf5713e22c3

Analyzing a corpus of 960 Instagram images, we first identify 14 tropes and then two overarching themes – haunted-place making and subversive imaging. We make three main points in this article. Firstly, we argue that the creation of Istana Woodneuk Instagram posts can be understood only against the backdrop of national anxieties about the constraint and control of land and history. Secondly, and relatedly, we posit that the bottom-up creation and collective sharing of these posts is an assertion of young Singaporean identity against a larger state narrative. Istana Woodneuk, in its ambiguity and hauntedness, along with Instagram's affordances, gives young Singaporeans a unique unregulated space for escape from ""reality"" and control. Thirdly, we argue that these Instagram posts blend frivolity and thoughtlessness with resistance and self-expression, where personal stories weave into a larger communal narrative that offers bottom-up alternatives to the state sponsored ""Singapore Story.""

"Library, Information Science & Technology Abstracts",lxh,157224771,Exploring determinants influencing information literacy with activity theory.,"Purpose: This study aimed to provide evidence to support the use of a wiki called PBworks as a learning tool to foster students' information literacy (IL) skills based on activity theory. Design/methodology/approach: The participants consisted of 421 students (i.e. form 1 to form 3) from Hong Kong taking a liberal studies course during the 2016–2017 academic year. This study mainly used a mixed methods design, proposing 11 hypotheses. Quantitative data from 374 questionnaires were analysed to test these research hypotheses, while a qualitative method (interviews) was used to explain the quantitative results. A structural equation modelling approach was used to analyse the data, and data triangulation was used to answer the same research questions. Findings: The results showed that the model components PBworks affordances (PB) and rules and divisions (RD) had significant direct effects on individual activities (IA) and community activities (CA) and significant indirect effects on information literacy (IL). The results also revealed that CA had a significant effect on IA and had an even greater effect on IL. Research limitations/implications: Using PBworks and the project-based learning (PjBL) approach, this study examined the determinants affecting the IL skills of Hong Kong junior secondary school students and proposed a wiki-based information literary activity (WILA) model. Practical implications: As students' IL skills have become increasingly important, this study can shed light on related topics for future studies. Social implications: And contribute to social stability and harmonious development. Originality/value: This study eventually confirmed the validity of the WILA model with all hypotheses supported.

However, what is meant by the 'subject' is not neutral and subjectification can differ according to cultural context. This study takes Middle Eastern women influencers' subjectification on TikTok as a case to illustrate postdigital transnational subjectification. The novel framework of feminist postdigital transnational inquiry is applied to the corpus assisted study of three Middle Eastern women influencers' short-form TikTok videos. The findings reveal observable audio-visual elements while embedding conceptual meanings surrounding subjectification. Discussion postulates subjectification on TikTok as living postdigital practices with transnational meanings both within and beyond their immediate context. It is suggested that subjectification could occur beyond regional, generational, traditional, fixed or essentialist terms. Theorising offers nuanced insights into the curatorial potential of TikTok for subjectification as consecutively interdependent with contextual issues, trends and deeper traditional audio-visual ontologies.

"Library, Information Science & Technology Abstracts",lxh,159020772,Preparing for the New Phygital Generation as Potential Academic Library Users in South African Higher Education.,"Context: Higher education and its academic support services, including academic library and information services (LIS), have continuously been challenged by new technological developments, as well as the quest for transformation toward more inclusive education. The rapid and disruptive technological changes imposed by the Fourth Industrial Revolution (4IR) heralded a new entry-level student, coined the ""phygital generation."" This new generation of library users is characterised by an ever-expanding digital imprint and a preference for using mobile technology to navigate all aspects of their daily lives, including how they approach their tertiary studies. Focus: The study interrogates the readiness of information specialists to understand the nature of the phygital generation within a higher education group in South Africa. The changes in information-seeking behaviour are explored with due cognisance of the existing digital exclusions experienced by many South African students. Methodology: Through the lens of the critical theory paradigm and guided by the conceptualisations of post-digital frameworks, critical digital approaches and metacognitive frameworks, qualitative data were collected during a focus group interview. The non-probability sample was purposively selected, consisting of information specialists of a school within a higher education institution. The transcribed data were coded and thematically analysed. Key findings: Key findings show a shift in the information-seeking behaviour of new entry-level students. There is a propensity towards using mobile technology. It is evident that LIS staff in this study are not yet mobilised to accommodate this new trend by adapting existing services to be more open to accommodating mobile technology seamlessly. The participants reported that academic writing skills are affected by short messaging styles used in social media. Understanding the nature of the new phygital student and capitalising on the affordances of mobile learning will support student success. Value: Mobile LIS urgently needs to be formalised and implemented strategically with the needs of the new generation in mind. The need for further institutional reform and innovation is evident. Further research is required on plagiarism trends, copyright infringement and privacy compliance that emerged from the findings of this study.",20220401,"van Wyk, Brenda",Article,Academic Journal,2022,true,Mousaion,Library users ; Academic libraries ; Technological innovations ; South Africa ; Higher education ; Mobile learning ; Industry 4.0 ; Disruptive innovations,JOUR,,,0027-2639,,,,,eng,Unisa Press,14,1,14,40,2,10.25159/2663-659X/10130,,RQO,,https://research.ebsco.com/linkprocessor/plink?id=42884d68-7c3d-3d73-80bc-56be851c8a01
"Library, Information Science & Technology Abstracts",lxh,156000952,Transformer-Based Abstractive Summarization for Reddit and Twitter: Single Posts vs. Comment Pools in Three Languages.,"Abstractive summarization is a technique that allows for extracting condensed meanings from long texts, with a variety of potential practical applications. Nonetheless, today's abstractive summarization research is limited to testing the models on various types of data, which brings only marginal improvements and does not lead to massive practical employment of the method. In particular, abstractive summarization is not used for social media research, where it would be very useful for opinion and topic mining due to the complications that social media data create for other methods of textual analysis. Of all social media, Reddit is most frequently used for testing new neural models of text summarization on large-scale datasets in English, without further testing on real-world smaller-size data in various languages or from various other platforms. Moreover, for social media, summarizing pools of texts (one-author posts, comment threads, discussion cascades, etc.) may bring crucial results relevant for social studies, which have not yet been tested. However, the existing methods of abstractive summarization are not fine-tuned for social media data and have next-to-never been applied to data from platforms beyond Reddit, nor for comments or non-English user texts. We address these research gaps by fine-tuning the newest Transformer-based neural network models LongFormer and T5 and testing them against BART, and on real-world data from Reddit, with improvements of up to 2%. Then, we apply the best model (fine-tuned T5) to pools of comments from Reddit and assess the similarity of post and comment summarizations. Further, to overcome the 500-token limitation of T5 for analyzing social media pools that are usually bigger, we apply LongFormer Large and T5 Large to pools of tweets from a large-scale discussion on the Charlie Hebdo massacre in three languages and prove that pool summarizations may be used for detecting micro-shifts in agendas of networked discussions. Our results show, however, that additional learning is definitely needed for German and French, as the results for these languages are non-satisfactory, and more fine-tuning is needed even in English for Twitter data. Thus, we show that a 'one-for-all' neural-network summarization model is still impossible to reach, while fine-tuning for platform affordances works well. We also show that fine-tuned T5 works best for small-scale social media data, but LongFormer is helpful for larger-scale pool summarizations.",20220301,"Blekanov, Ivan S. ; Tarasov, Nikita ; Bodrunova, Svetlana S.",Article,Academic Journal,Mar2022,true,Future Internet,Social media ; Artificial neural networks ; Microblogs ; Sentiment analysis ; Natural language processing ; X Corp. ; User-generated content ; Social sciences education ; Charlie Hebdo (Periodical),JOUR,,,1999-5903,,,,,eng,MDPI,69,69,1,14,3,10.3390/fi14030069,,B74E,,https://research.ebsco.com/linkprocessor/plink?id=d2715c2e-c105-3a86-a508-dd1f2df6f55d
"Library, Information Science & Technology Abstracts",lxh,155630768,Let's talk about risks: a pillar framework for social media risk management in memory institutions.,"Purpose: While memory institutions' use of social media has proliferated, research and scholarly literature on risks, resulting from social media use, memory institutions' social media risk-aware culture and, in particular, social media risk management remains scant. This study addresses this knowledge gap and identifies aspects of social media risk management from other sectors that could inform the cultural heritage sector. Design/methodology/approach: This research involves a review of the scholarly and professional literature that contribute to social media risk management discourses. These include those that discuss the different categories of social media risks, social media policies, risk-aware culture and social media risk management strategies and processes. Works discussing social media risk management models and frameworks are also included in the review. Based on the insights gained from these reviews, a pillar framework to guide social media risk management in memory institutions is developed. Findings: The proposed framework outlines the baseline components relevant for the cultural heritage sector and underlines the evolving and continual nature of these components. Elements particularly important to memory institutions are highlighted. Notably, that social risks as a risk category must be recognised. Also noted is that the conventional apolitical stance still taken by many memory institutions need to be reviewed. The importance of memory institutions to be not overly risk-averse to the point of failing to take advantage of the affordances of social media platforms, thereby stifling potential innovations around services and engagement with their users/audience is discussed. Originality/value: This research offers an extensive review of the social media risk management literature, both scholarly and professional across different domains. The ensuing insights inform the development of a pillar framework to guide social media risk management in memory institutions. The framework outlines a baseline mapping of the governance, processes and systems components. The expectation is that this framework could be extended to account for contextual and situational requirements at more granular levels to reflect the nuances, variances and complexities that exist among different types of memory institutions and to account for varying attributes, mandates and priorities in the cultural heritage sector.",20220301,"Liew, Chern Li",Article,Academic Journal,2022,true,Online Information Review,Social media ; Cultural property ; Hyacinthoides ; Mass media policy ; Social institutions,JOUR,,,1468-4527,,,,,eng,Emerald Publishing Limited,390,375,16,46,2,10.1108/OIR-08-2020-0380,,9NA,,https://research.ebsco.com/linkprocessor/plink?id=ff432911-3e53-3509-be30-94cd2f6ffbf9
"Library, Information Science & Technology Abstracts",lxh,155550756,Informatic tactics: Indigenous activism and digital cartographies of gender-based violence.,"The impact of crowdsourced data visualization in the Missing and Murdered Indigenous Women (#MMIW) movement over the last decade reveals how institutional systems of organizing and representing space present a key obstacle to the cause. Activists' digital crowdmaps express an ethos of Indigenous data sovereignty, or self-determination in data collection and application, that interrogates settler data procedures relative to gender violence. These tactical maps resonate with the circulation of location-tagged photographs via social media campaigns like #ImNotNext and #RedDressProject to similarly critique the datasets of government agencies. This article conceptualizes both media forms as informatic images that intervene in settler cartographic practice as part of an ongoing decolonization of digital mapping tools. Informatic images precondition the ways that users interact with data through hypermediated visual systems. Here, digital mapping and locative media practices focalize a relationship between violence, biased data and space, through various methods of layering, compositing and linking. Settler computational structures undergird these affordances, yet in a tactical context mapped images are reconstituted by user interaction with an oppositional dataset to intervene in that framework. Users' emergent data of presence and absence plot a distributed landscape of settler violence in accordance, instead, with relational Indigenous knowledges.",20220301,"Miner, Joshua D.",Article,Academic Journal,Mar2022,true,"Information, Communication & Society",Digital mapping ; Digital technology ; Violence against women ; Digital maps ; Activism ; Indigenous women ; Cartography,JOUR,,,1369-118X,,,,,eng,Taylor & Francis Ltd,448,431,18,25,3,10.1080/1369118X.2020.1797851,,5BA,,https://research.ebsco.com/linkprocessor/plink?id=3610223b-dc3f-3193-a95f-2f18d2da8839

Users often access this information on online fitness communities (OFCs) such as RunKeeper or Strava. These OFCs do not only provide feedback on the user's performance but also offer social features. To date, little is known about the extent to which the different features in OFCs answer to users' motivations to exercise. This study addresses this question, by examining (1) whether there are differences in motivations for running between OFC users and non-users and (2) whether the use of particular features is driven by particular running motivations. A survey study was conducted among 717 runners, of which 57% used an OFC to support running activities. Results demonstrate that OFC users are more achievement-oriented than non-OFC users, especially regarding the attainment of personal goals. OFC users with physical motivations (e.g. weight loss) use self-regulatory features more frequently, while runners with social motivations more often use features that afford them to share activities on social media. Achievement-oriented runners appreciate features that allow them to track their progress and interact with other OFC users. No relation was found between the use of OFC features and psychological motivations for running.",20180801,"Stragier, Jeroen ; Vanden Abeele, Mariek ; De Marez, Lieven",Article,Academic Journal,Aug2018,true,Behaviour & Information Technology,Conceptual structures ; Factor analysis ; Research ; Surveys ; Belgium ; Netherlands ; Athletes ; Autonomy (Psychology) ; Chi-squared test ; Goal (Psychology) ; Motivation (Psychology) ; Physical fitness centers ; Recreation ; Running ; Scale analysis (Psychology) ; Wearable technology,JOUR,,,0144-929X,,,,,eng,Taylor & Francis Ltd,827,815,13,37,8,10.1080/0144929X.2018.1484516,,B6Q,,https://research.ebsco.com/linkprocessor/plink?id=f04587f1-0373-3405-8968-b6b3bd697024

An examination of principals' perceptions of the usefulness of teacher open badges in the United States.,"In this article, we examined school leaders' perceptions of open badges for teacher candidates. We emailed one of two forms of a survey to principals and assistant principals in five school districts in the United States. Form A used wording about digital badges while form B used the term microcredentials. Both forms included open-ended questions. We compared the results of the surveys and examined the results of the open-ended questions. We found that using the term microcredential instead of the term digital badge did not have a significant effect on employers' perceptions on open badges. However, providing a small amount of instruction regarding the affordances of open badges did produce a statistically significant difference in the perceived value of open badges. Employers saw the most value in achievement and capability badges. The evidence link and endorsements from established professional organisations were identified as important tools to employers.

Parents and 4-7-year-olds (N = 64) played at a circuit block exhibit. They were first given blocks with descriptive (e.g., ""This is a battery."") or discovery-prompting (e.g., ""There is no wrong way to play."") messages, and after 90 seconds, given more blocks with the other message type. Children who received discovery-prompting messages second – after being allowed to explore the affordances of the circuit blocks with the descriptive messages – played at the exhibit longer, and participated in more circuit-building challenges on their own. Parents were also sensitive to the order of the messaging; it related to the ways in which they interacted with their children at the exhibit. We conclude by considering how the timing of messages families receive at an exhibit relates to the way they engage with the exhibit.

"Library, Information Science & Technology Abstracts",lxh,156517609,"Swimming with the ""Current"": An Access-Informed Exploration of Envisioned Blended Learning at Tishreen University in Syria.","Today, Tishreen university in Syria is translating its emergency response to crises-prompted disruptions into an intentional blended learning model through the official inception of Moodle. The present study adopts a holistic approach to explore faculty's perceptions of this transition at the Higher Institute of languages. To this end, four pilot interviews, the researcher's lived experience and the literature were used to design a web-based questionnaire. The questionnaire, completed by 23 teachers, elicited comparative reflections on teachers' access to Moodle as opposed to their other digitally mediated informal experiences of access, mainly to YouTube. Analysis was largely informed by the digital divide layers: physical-material, instrumental (tool-related), substantial (content-related), motivational, and usage-related. The article argues that re-thinking academic structure and infrastructure is irreducibly grounded in formal-informal networked experiences. Although access divide models have evolved vertically into layers or generations, the current study suggests the need for a horizontal expansion. Firstly, current access divide models do not lucidly reflect distinctions between formal and informal access. Since the digital landscape we increasingly inhabit is not monthlithic in terms of its affordances, structure, modality or genre of information; formal and informal access outcomes are necessarily diverse, yet dynamically intersecting. Secondly, despite accentuating the role of digital proficiency theoretically, access research only tangentially differentiates between the consumption versus production dimensions of substantial content-related skills access. Questions regarding the impact of access on effective blended learning models in general and on academic knowledge in particular, emerge from the data. It is hoped that future research will fathom these distinctions and the relationships between them more profoundly to empower similar initiatives of transition.

The shift from in-person to virtual meetings has multiple consequences, some of which impact recordkeeping. Design/methodology/approach: Drawing on research from records management, anthropology, organizational theory and computer science, this study establishes the norms of physical meeting spaces and recordkeeping and explores how these norms are challenged as meetings become virtual. Findings: Virtual meetings allow for collaboration to work across time and space and offer multiple affordances that do not exist in on-site meetings; however, they also involve the additional barrier of technical access and reduction in user attention. Virtual meetings also enable the creation, capture and sharing of increased contextual data, and this increased documentation challenges traditional recordkeeping models. Meeting technologies are also worryingly invasive. This study shows that concerns over privacy have been dismissed in the design of virtual meeting spaces, and therefore the authors recommend their more thorough consideration.

"Library, Information Science & Technology Abstracts",lxh,155586408,Back to Fukushima: Perceptions and effects of an immersive journalism story.,"News media organizations have been experimenting with immersive journalism formats in recent years. The search for new ways to tell stories is driven by technology and has given rise to new –and not so new– forms of expression. The initial enthusiasm has dissipated over the years, so the uncertainty of the future of immersive journalism justifies the study of the most potential ways of using this technology in journalism. This research was carried out in Finland and Spain, and it is based on a textual narrative analysis and a reception study comparing the online article and 360º video versions of the report Fukushima: Contaminated Lives from El país. The results identify the affordances of both formats and confirm that immersive journalism has the capacity to generate a greater emotional effect based on a greater perception of presence, realism and involvement, also having a positive impact on increasing interest and changing opinions on related topics. The narration of online article seems to work better only if there is large amount of information that has to be understood and contextualized. However, authors claim that, instead of an essential break, there are similarities between both formats, which are situated on the same continuum of emotionality and rationality. These findings also indicate that immersive storytelling can be an important part of the emotional or affective turn in contemporary journalism.

The study identified three main aspects of the analogy: (1) information landscapes as spaces affording the accomplishment of information practices, (2) information landscapes as spaces entwining physical and imaginary qualities and (3) information landscapes as socially constructed spatial contexts of information practices. The findings suggest that the construct of information landscapes represents a spatial analogy in which the properties of the source domain partially elucidate the nature of the contexts of information practices. The analogy works best with regard to similarities between affordances offered by natural landscapes and information landscapes. The major limitation of the analogy deals with difficulties to map physical features of the source domain onto the cognitive and social qualifiers of the target domain.",20211201,"Savolainen, Reijo",Article,Academic Journal,Dec2021,true,Journal of Librarianship & Information Science,Analogy ; Landscapes ; Natural landscaping ; Cognition,JOUR,,,0961-0006,,,,,eng,"Sage Publications, Ltd.",667,655,13,53,4,10.1177/0961000620982359,,RTT,,https://research.ebsco.com/linkprocessor/plink?id=6e095663-5e88-3563-a74e-a444c28cdabe
"Library, Information Science & Technology Abstracts",lxh,153433983,Uncovering generative mechanisms of information use for project monitoring in humanitarian health management information systems.,"Humanitarian medical organizations rely on information on and from the ground to evaluate their effectiveness and accountability. Related digitalization efforts within health information systems assume an instrumental rationality in the use of data. However, previous research identified a multitude of factors influencing actual information use for evidence‐based decision‐making for healthcare delivery. This case study, anchored by critical realism philosophy, unpacks these nuances against the backdrop of a globally operating organization (Médecins Sans Frontières). It aims to highlight the contextual conditions and structures that enact the contingent mechanisms at work in project monitoring within humanitarian health management information systems. By applying an affordance‐based causal analysis, three mechanisms are identified: first, an analytics service provides templated analysis modalities resulting in user–producer–provider relationships; second, the rationalization and synchronization of content and software artifacts gives rise to the standardization strategy of flexible generification; third, the study uncovers the potential for increased internal social discourse and advocacy through collaborative and mobile data analysis. This paper proposes that mechanism‐based explanations can be useful for theory‐building in information systems research as well as for providing insights to practitioners in the humanitarian health sector.",20211101,"Huser, David ; Bon, Anna ; Anifalaje, Adebusoye",Article,Academic Journal,Nov2021,true,Electronic Journal of Information Systems in Developing Countries,Médecins Sans Frontières (Association) ; Health information systems ; Discourse analysis ; Social advocacy ; Synchronization software ; Contingent employment ; Critical realism,JOUR,,,1681-4835,,,,,eng,Wiley-Blackwell,18,1,18,87,6,10.1002/isd2.12184,,1D48,,https://research.ebsco.com/linkprocessor/plink?id=7c58e64c-09f8-3fad-acc1-fc805257ab21
"Library, Information Science & Technology Abstracts",lxh,154508731,Project management: openings for disruption from AI and advanced analytics.,"Purpose: The purpose of this essay is to illustrate how project management ""pull"" and AI or analytics technology ""push"" are likely to result in incremental and disruptive evolution of project management capabilities and practices. Design/methodology/approach: This paper is written as a critical essay reflecting the experience and reflections of the author with many ideas drawn from and extending selected items from project management, artificial intelligence (AI) and analytics literatures. Findings: Neither AI nor sophisticated analytics is likely to elicit hands on attention from project managers, other than those producing AI or analytics-based artifacts or using these tools to create their products and services. However, through the conduit of packaged software support for project management, new tools and approaches can be expected to more effectively support current activities, to streamline or eliminate activities that can be automated, to extend current capabilities with the availability of increased data, computing capacity and mathematically based algorithms and to suggest ways to reconceive how projects are done and whether they are needed. Research limitations/implications: This essay includes projections of possible, some likely and some unlikely, events and states that have not yet occurred. Although the hope and purpose are to alert readers to the possibilities of what may occur as logical extensions of current states, it is improbable that all such projections will come to pass at all or in the way described. Nonetheless, consideration of the future ranging from current trends, the interplay among intersecting trends and scenarios of future states can sharpen awareness of the effects of current choices regarding actions, decisions and plans improving the probability that the authors can move toward desired rather than undesired future states. Practical implications: Project managers not involved personally with creating AI or analytics products can avoid mastering detailed skill sets in AI and analytics, but should scan for new software features and affordances that they can use enable new levels of productivity, net benefit creation and ability to sleep well at night.

This article, in contrast, approaches gender from a behind the screen perspective. How algorithms and platforms are created, designed, and maintained, the affordances they provide for users and how they govern the ways users communicate with each other, has a major impact on digital communication. However, it is mostly men who create these technologies. Our study approaches technologies as socio-cultural, departing from the concept of network media logic. Empirically, it is based on (1) the review of a diverse body of literature from the history of programming, professional sociology, and computer science and documents such as the diversity reports from tech giants, as well as on (2) 64 semi-structured expert interviews conducted with male and female programmers in seven countries over a time-period of four years.

"Library, Information Science & Technology Abstracts",lxh,145292509,FINDING SHIMMER: IMMERSIVE NONFICTION MEDIA AND ENTANGLEMENTS IN VIRTUAL NATURE.,"In this article I explore how immersive nonfiction media works may offer a scaffold for an ecological imagination that entangles us, humans, within the environment, rather than othering nature and conceiving of it as something 'out there'. Taking as a frame the intersection of documentary studies and emerging creative media technologies, and connecting this frame with Barad's (2007) concept of entanglement and Zunino Harper's (2016) construction of naturecultures, I examine discourses of nature in digital media representation. Immersive and experiential media forms offer a number of particular affordances which are reviewed here - including generating a sense of presence, use of embodiment and layering and scaling of environments. A number of non-fiction immersive media works are presented as case studies, in which I explore their use of these affordances and their engagement with ecological narratives. Using immersion to engender awe at nature is considered, and while studies seem to show that this is indeed possible, I suggest that there are contingent risks of othering nature. Instead, a development of a sense of bewilderment or shimmer - incorporating complexity, ritual, wonder, humanity and ecology - seems a more likely route to re-minding us of our nature entanglements. Similarly, there are parallels in othering nature and in crafting contained virtual worlds for participants to step into and out of. I argue, building on Speakman's (2019) writing and creative practice, that an approach that further embeds us within and augments our existing reality, may be more effective in maintaining a sense of entanglement. There are certainly a multitude of rich creative routes to further explore this, and thus practice-led approaches are offered as a vital prong in the work to address climate and ecological crisis.",20200401,"Scott-Stevenson, Julia",Article,Academic Journal,2020,true,Digital Culture & Education,Digital media ; Environmental education ; Virtual reality,JOUR,,,1836-8301,,,,,eng,Digital Culture & Education,19,1,19,24,2,,,FDOX,,https://research.ebsco.com/linkprocessor/plink?id=52174620-0da7-3568-a471-6bfbe7c2f526

"Library, Information Science & Technology Abstracts",lxh,141257987,Orchestrating enterprise social media for knowledge co-creation: an interactionist perspective.,"Purpose: This paper aims to present a conceptual framework of four knowledge co-creation processes in enterprise social media (ESM). From an interactionist perspective, the paper proposes a model on the role of ESM and enterprise social networks (ESNs) in facilitating knowledge co-creation processes. Design/methodology/approach: This conceptual paper revisits existing literature on ESM, ESNs and social knowledge management to propose, hypothetically, the relationship between ESM, ESN and knowledge co-creation processes. Findings: ESM enhances employee-to-employee interaction, which allows employees to co-create knowledge in a social context. Firstly, ESM affords employees to create ESNs for knowledge co-creation. Secondly, the structure of employee-to-employee interaction in ESNs will influence knowledge co-creation processes. Thirdly, ESNs provide the mechanism through which ESM affordances enable or constrain knowledge co-creation in the organisation. Practical implications: ESM creates a social context that allows employees to share, apply and recreate or reproduce knowledge in the process of knowledge co-creation. The action possibilities of ESM perceived and actualised by employees will enable or constrain knowledge co-creation. Such influences are fuelled by the structural properties of employee relationships on ESM. Originality/value: The paper elucidates the concept of knowledge co-creation based on a representation of user activities in ESM. This paper suggests that knowledge co-creation is a salient outcome of both individual-to-individual interactions on ESM and individual-to-ESM interactions enabled by ESM affordances.",20200101,"Namisango, Fatuma ; Kafuko, Maria Miiro ; Byomire, Gorretti",Article,Academic Journal,2020,true,VINE: The Journal of Information & Knowledge Management Systems,Social media ; Knowledge management ; Social enterprises ; Social networks,JOUR,,,2059-5891,,,,,eng,Emerald Publishing Limited,74,57,18,50,1,10.1108/VJIKMS-12-2018-0115,,JX5,,https://research.ebsco.com/linkprocessor/plink?id=77067deb-4ad1-384b-9a06-41c84e85babe

What might a social media that facilitates youth political expression look like? We address this question by examining young people's experiences with the mobile social media Yik Yak, whose affordances (i.e., anonymity, geo-boundedness, ephemerality) offer a theoretically beneficial infrastructure for political expression. Using in-depth interviews conducted during the 2016 US election, we find that Yik Yak's affordances allowed users to assess the opinions of their peers, experiment with political expression and articulate their political voices. Participants also raised concerns over whether political talk on social media like Yik Yak could result in substantive dialogue or meaningful change.

However, research in this area of librarianship, although growing, has not kept pace. In this paper, two veteran children's librarians, who are now both emerging early literacy scholars, collaborate on a reexamination of a small segment of existing data in order to demonstrate the affordances of returning to data with another theoretical lens, and doing what they refer to as an ""alternate reading."" By tracing the findings that emerge from both of their theoretical lenses, specifically, Bronfenbrenner's bioecological systems theory and Brandt and Clinton's literacy-in-action, the authors demonstrate the strengths of such collaborations with their chosen theories. They show that using these two different theoretical lenses on the same data allows for other possible meanings to emerge and reveals other threads to follow. These alternate readings lead to deeper understandings of the data and point to other potential areas of research. In an under-studied field such as early literacy in libraries, the authors believe this dual-lens approach to data analysis may inspire other researchers to draw on disparate theories when studying early literacy in public libraries.",20211001,"Prendergast, Tess ; Sharkey, Karen",Article,Academic Journal,Fall2021,true,Library Trends,Public libraries ; Library services for children ; Children's librarians ; Emergent literacy ; Ecological systems theory,JOUR,,,0024-2594,,,,,eng,Johns Hopkins University Press,18,1,18,70,2,10.1353/lib.2021.0023,,LIT,,https://research.ebsco.com/linkprocessor/plink?id=4ac5a516-5047-3157-a881-589fbb0d4029

The form of these networks is duplicated in the method of Howe's poetic practice, which is often Bartleby-esque, interchanging Howe's words with those lifted from previous published and unpublished texts (often without attribution), and then alternatively editing, cutting, pasting, and re-writing them. Howe's work suggests a model of authorship that questions the dichotomies of handwriting (or marginalia) and printing, authors and editors, and ultimately, autonomy and the network. This essay argues that Howe's observation and proliferation of these print cultural networks is both an attempt to make visible and material the multiplicity of print network's nodes, while also critiquing the concepts of authorship, authenticity, and ownership that undergird it.

A systematic literature review and framework of social media-induced jealousy.,"Purpose: The association between social media and jealousy is an aspect of the dark side of social media that has garnered significant attention in the past decade. However, the understanding of this association is fragmented and needs to be assimilated to provide scholars with an overview of the current boundaries of knowledge in this area. This systematic literature review (SLR) aims to fulfill this need. Design/methodology/approach: The authors undertake an SLR to assimilate the current knowledge regarding the association between social media and jealousy, and they examine the phenomenon of social media-induced jealousy (SoMJ). Forty-five empirical studies are curated and analyzed using stringent protocols to elucidate the existing research profile and thematic research areas. Findings: The research themes emerging from the SLR are (1) the need for a theoretical and methodological grounding of the concept, (2) the sociodemographic differences in SoMJ experiences, (3) the antecedents of SoMJ (individual, partner, rival and platform affordances) and (4) the positive and negative consequences of SoMJ. Conceptual and methodological improvements are needed to undertake a temporal and cross-cultural investigation of factors that may affect SoMJ and acceptable thresholds for social media behavior across different user cohorts.

The use of AI chatbots for labour organising in the US and Australia.,"Artificial intelligence increasingly forms an essential context for the distribution of power within workplaces. Using the case study of an AI‐enabled chatbot initially created by IBM and subsequently developed by an alt‐labour network in the United States and a traditional union in Australia, this article outlines several distinctive ways in which the chatbot increased union resources and capabilities. Once reconfigured to reflect an 'organising', rather than 'servicing' ethos, the chatbot became an infrastructural resource that enabled otherwise marginal workers to receive basic information in a manner that reinforced union narratives of power and worker solidarity, and workplaces to be mapped more efficiently. The chatbot did not act as a labour saving tool, but stimulated wide‐ranging learning by bringing implicit tensions between 'servicing' and 'organising' conceptions of knowledge, power and expertise to the surface.

One of the major affordances of Instagram is the creation and posting of pictures. This allows for the production of photographic self-representations – one of the central aspects of contemporary everyday social media practices. Yet, these practices, deeply intertwined with the politics of gender representation, are often dismissed as trivial. Following a feminist media studies approach, grounded in the tradition of cultural studies, this research seeks to provide a critical and qualitative exploration of how young women using Instagram understand gendered self-representational practices. To do so, we conducted 13 in-depth interviews with 'ordinary' female Instagram users (i.e., not celebrities, influencers, or 'Insta-famous' users) aged 18–35 years. Our findings illustrate how these understandings are rooted in complex negotiations and can combine contradictory discourses. They emphasize the importance of attentive curation in self-representational practices, acknowledging the influence of social and aesthetic conventions of photographable and Instagrammable. These findings highlight the tensions surrounding the idea of self-representation, acknowledging its potential as an empowering practice, while simultaneously recognizing the users' need to negotiate the culturally prevalent negative and gendered stereotypes about selfie-taking. Furthermore, it also explores the existing negotiations between the desires to engage with popular Instagrammable aesthetics, while still grounding these practices on a sense of authenticity.",20210615,"Caldeira, Sofia P. ; Van Bauwel, Sofie ; Ridder, Sander De",Article,Academic Journal,Jun2021,true,"Information, Communication & Society",Social media ; Young women ; Social influence ; Media studies ; Cultural studies ; Representative government,JOUR,,,1369-118X,,,,,eng,Taylor & Francis Ltd,1090,1073,18,24,8,10.1080/1369118X.2020.1776371,,5BA,,https://research.ebsco.com/linkprocessor/plink?id=f896e6ba-f8b2-385a-af8e-5c9efb3c7790

Through thematic analysis two conceptual themes emerged: (a) Supporting learning in live lectures and (b) Self-customisation of learning. Students saw lecture capture as just one of a number of digital resources available to them, and their choice of resource depended on resource affordances, the way in which information was presented in lectures and their beliefs about learning.

"Library, Information Science & Technology Abstracts",lxh,150343777,Digital records as relational objects–Yuk Hui's concept of digital objects applied to archival science.,"The writings of Yuk Hui, bringing together both technical and philosophical insights, present a new way of dealing with the digital. The aim of this article is to assess the use of Hui's theories on digital objects as a critical reframing, looking at the concept of digital records in particular. Two types of ontology are needed in order to understand digital objects according to Hui: (1) ontologies which relates to the technical language and hierarchies of knowledge representation, like metadata; (2) Ontology, which is a question of being-in-the-tradition of Heidegger's phenomenology, the understanding of what it is to be in the world. Both are needed to account for the nature of the digital object. Further, digital objects are produced and constituted through their relations, which can be divided into discursive (technical and logical) and existential (the understanding of being-in-the-world) relations. Different conceptions of digital records are discussed, in order to find commonalities and possibilities in relation to Hui's theory.

"Library, Information Science & Technology Abstracts",lxh,150389309,Privacy and smart speakers: A multi-dimensional approach.,"Over the last few years, smart speakers such as Amazon Echo and Google Home have become increasingly present within British households. Yet, privacy remains a prominent concern in the public discourse about smart speakers, as well as in the nascent academic literature. We argue that privacy in the context of smart speakers is more complex than in other settings due to smart speakers' specific technological affordances and also the axial relationships between users, the device, device manufacturers, application developers, and other third parties such as moderation contractors and data brokers. With survey data from Amazon Echo and Google Home users in the UK, we explore users' privacy concerns and privacy protection behaviors related to smart speakers. We rely on a contextual understanding of privacy, assessing the prevalence of seven distinct privacy concern types as well as three privacy protection behaviors. The results indicate that concerns about third parties, such as contractors listening to smart speaker recordings, are most pronounced. Privacy protection behaviors are uncommon but partly affected by privacy concerns and motives such as social presence and utilitarian benefits. Taken together, our research paints a picture of privacy pragmatism or privacy cynicism among smart speaker users.",20210501,"Lutz, Christoph ; Newlands, Gemma",Article,Academic Journal,May-Jun2021,true,Information Society,Privacy ; United Kingdom ; Amazon.com Inc. ; Smart speakers ; Amazon Echo ; Google Home,JOUR,,,0197-2243,,,,,eng,Taylor & Francis Ltd,162,147,16,37,3,10.1080/01972243.2021.1897914,,1HQ,,https://research.ebsco.com/linkprocessor/plink?id=17477aac-f018-3169-ba33-d123eaa549a1

Technology integration cognition should thus be thought of as pedagogical design thinking that involves critically examining the affordances of learning technologies and then strategically applying them to teach particular subject matter ideas within a specific classroom context. To better describe such teacher cognition concerning technology integration, this study proposes TPACK-L, an expanded framework for teachers' technology integration knowledge, by adding the principles of learning theory to the existing TPACK framework, and delineates what this pedagogical design thinking looks like in the context of a specially designed card game, CARD-tamen™.

The current Chinese administration considers social media 'the main battlefield for public opinion struggle' between the official discourse and those challenging it. To provide clues about who is shaping the public opinion, this study examined how consuming news from competing information sources on social media influences Chinese citizens' satisfaction with the central and local government. Based on a nationally representative survey of 2,882 Chinese adults, the study found that consuming news from governmental sources on the country's major social media platforms – Weibo and WeChat – was positively associated with citizens' satisfaction with the central government, while exposure to alternative news sources on WeChat had a negative impact on both central and local government satisfaction. Additionally, news consumption from mainstream media sources on social media did not significantly influence the public's government satisfaction.

"Library, Information Science & Technology Abstracts",lxh,149245637,Unlocking the smart home: exploring key factors affecting the smart lock adoption intention.,"Purpose: This study examines the factorial structure of salient user beliefs associated with smart locks. We also examine the predictive value of the identified constructs on the smart lock adoption intention and we evaluate gender differences in the predictive value of the identified constructs. Design/methodology/approach: The study assumes pragmatic epistemological stance and it leverages mixed-methods research design. The research progresses through three stages: belief elicitation, exploratory factor analysis and confirmatory factor analysis within a nomological network. New groups of participants were recruited for each stage of the study. Findings: We find that while potential adopters express a broad range of perceived benefits and concerns associated with smart locks, only the perceived relative advantage of smart locks vis-à-vis conventional locks in providing safety and security is significantly correlated with adoption intention for both genders. We also find that perceived novel benefits are a significant predictor of the smart lock adoption intention for women, but not for men. Research limitations/implications: Our results indicate that perceived relative advantage can be the singular critical consideration in the adoption of smart home technologies that replace incumbent solutions. The results also demonstrate that gender-specific models can better capture gender effects that influence technology adoption and use. Practical implications: Smart home technology vendors would need to convince prospective users that new technology is better than the incumbent solutions on the core affordances of the incumbent technology. Men and women differ in the consideration of novel benefits afforded by novel technologies. Originality/value: This is among the first studies to examine salient beliefs that affect smart home technology adoption. The findings suggest that the traditional models (TAM, UTAUT) do not capture the key salient beliefs that can influence innovative smart home technology adoption. The study also suggests that gendered models are needed to understand technology adoption in contexts where technology adoption intersects with gender roles.",20210301,"Mamonov, Stanislav ; Benbunan-Fich, Raquel",Article,Academic Journal,2021,true,Information Technology & People,Innovation adoption ; Smart locks ; Smart homes ; Pragmatics ; Confirmatory factor analysis ; Exploratory factor analysis ; Locks & keys ; Elicitation technique ; Health Belief Model,JOUR,,,0959-3845,,,,,eng,Emerald Publishing Limited,861,835,27,34,2,10.1108/ITP-07-2019-0357,,67S,,https://research.ebsco.com/linkprocessor/plink?id=3a3b33cb-2041-3ca8-a461-a70eb79faf0c

One facet of this welcoming vision was a Woman's Department, where Julia Ward Howe and daughter Maud Howe gathered a literary exhibition, a library of books by women. Maud Howe left the books to the city of New Orleans, but she and her mother also left a legacy of the library's contents in a shelf list naming the some 1,400 books.

Design/methodology/approach: The story completion method was brought together with De Certeau's concept of tactics and more-than-human theoretical perspectives. Participants were presented with four story stems on an online platform. Each story stem introduced a fictional character confronted with a digital privacy dilemma. Participants were asked to complete the stories by typing in open text boxes, responding to the prompts ""How does the character feel? What does she/he do? What happens next?"". A total of 29 participants completed the stories, resulting in a corpus of 116 narratives for a theory-driven thematic analysis. Findings: The stories vividly demonstrate the ways in which tactics are entangled with relational connections and affective intensities. They highlight the micropolitical dimensions of human–nonhuman affordances when people are responding to third-party use of their personal information. The stories identified the tactics used and boundaries that are drawn in people's sense-making concerning how they define appropriate and inappropriate use of their data. Originality/value: This paper demonstrates the value and insights of creatively attending to personal data privacy issues in ways that decentre the autonomous tactical and agential individual and instead consider the more-than-human relationality of privacy.

Pedagogical research into teaching videos has been broadly positive and focussed on their benefits for students' experience as well as how specific features of films can enhance learning and attainment. Although these studies are useful, few consider the perceptions of the students who watch the films and the teachers who make them. This article focuses on astudy conducted with distance learning students and teachers from one university in England to discover their attitudes to teaching videos. The exploratory study found that although amajority of distance students like and watch the videos, asignificant proportion give good reasons for not doing so. The main finding from the research is it is the quality of the teacher, as opposed to the affordances that technology offers, that is perceived to have the most impact on student learning.

"Library, Information Science & Technology Abstracts",lxh,146849933,Live democracy and its tensions: making sense of livestreaming in the 15M and Occupy.,"Drawing on one hundred interviews with activists, this article examines the relationship between livestreaming and the democratic cultures of the 15M and Occupy movements. The article investigates how the technical affordances of livestreaming – immediacy, rawness, liveness and embedded/embodied perspective – connect with the movements' understandings of how democracy should be practiced, specifically in terms of political equality, participation and transparency. Our findings identify four sources of tension in the relationship between livestreaming and democratic cultures. Firstly, the use of livestreaming was associated with a radical interpretation of transparency as near-total visibility, which gave rise to tensions around self-surveillance. Secondly, the information overload created through the practice of radical transparency was in tension with the movement's accountability processes. Thirdly, live streamers attempted to offer an unvarnished access to truth by providing unedited and raw video from the streets. Yet their embodied and subjective first-person perspective was associated with tensions around their power to shape the broadcast. Finally, while livestreaming was used to facilitate equal participation in the movement, participation through the livestream took the meaning of equal access to the experience of the squares, rather than equal power in the decision-making process. Our research reveals that despite the national particularities of the contexts in which they arose, Occupy and the 15M were extremely similar in their interpretations and practices of livestreaming and democracy.",20201101,"Kavada, Anastasia ; Treré, Emiliano",Article,Academic Journal,Nov2020,true,"Information, Communication & Society",Information overload ; Occupy protest movement ; Democracy ; Political culture ; Computer performance,JOUR,,,1369-118X,,,,,eng,Taylor & Francis Ltd,1804,1787,18,23,12,10.1080/1369118X.2019.1637448,,5BA,,https://research.ebsco.com/linkprocessor/plink?id=4750debb-ab54-3564-8e1e-58e8a4e2bc57

In demonstrating how ‘gene talk’ aids and speeds the circulation of findings based on personal data, the discussion cast light on how personal data gain value in people’s lives, thereby enhancing their readiness to position themselves as data subjects. Users are offered a data-enhanced existence, a ‘lifeworld inc.’, in which new kinds of ontological horizons are promoted by technical developments that produce numbers and calculable coordinates for descriptive regimes. Arguing that debates on DTC genetic testing and uses of personal data benefit from a more thorough analysis both of translations of genetic knowledge and emerging data practices, the aim is to critically address the active work by users that keeps genetic data alive, including the emotional longings and practical capabilities that people have in terms of genetic knowledge.

Abstract Mobile social platform such as WeChat Moments has gained great popularity in China in the past few years. However, there are still a lack of studies that focus on Guanxi network building in the virtual social community. Drawing upon social capital theory and technology affordance theory, this study develops a research model to examine the influences of platform media richness and interactivity on users' social capital and participation behaviors in the WeChat Moments. An empirical survey was conducted in China and 287 valid data were collected from WeChat users. Structural equation modelling analysis was used to test the research model. The empirical results suggest that platform interactivity and media richness are significant technology affordances that promote users' Guanxi network, and their influences are mediated by social interaction and shared understanding.

Abstract Over the last few years the sharing economy has been changing the way that people share and conduct transactions in digital spaces. This research phenomenon has drawn scholars from a large number of disparate fields and disciplines into an emerging research area. Given the variety of perspectives represented, there is a great need to collect and connect what has been done, and to identify some common themes, which will serve as a basis for future discussions on the crucial roles played by digital platforms in the sharing economy. Drawing on a collection of 435 publications on the sharing economy and related terms, we identify some trends in the literature and underlying research interests. Specifically, we organize the literature around the concept of platform mediation, and draw a set of essential affordances of sharing economy technologies from the reviewed literature. We present the notion of platform centralization/decentralization as an effective organizing principle for the variety of perspectives on the sharing economy, and also evaluate scholars' treatment of technology itself.

Current studies – predominantly informed by positivist and interpretivist paradigms – produce analyses and prescriptions designed without an in‐depth understanding of the underlying mechanisms influencing performance. The result is limited ability to explain how organisational performance is enabled by ICT. Critical realism as a philosophy of science provides a deeper ontological and broader epistemological approach that makes it possible to theorise the micro‐level mechanisms that hold potential for explaining observed outcomes. The study reported here, informed by the critical realism paradigm, uses interviews, observation and organisational data collected from a single case study to identify the resource optimisation micro‐level generative mechanisms that have improved emergency medical services.

"Library, Information Science & Technology Abstracts",lxh,146829806,Causal mechanisms and institutionalisation of open government data in Kenya.,"Open data—including open government data (OGD)—has become a topic of prominence during the last decade. However, most governments have not realised the desired value streams or outcomes from OGD. The Kenya Open Data Initiative (KODI), a Government of Kenya initiative, is no exception with some moments of success but also sustainability struggles. Therefore, the focus for this paper is to understand the causal mechanisms that either enable or constrain institutionalisation of OGD initiatives. Critical realism is ideally suited as a paradigm to identify such mechanisms, but guides to its operationalisation are few. This study uses the operational approach of Bygstad, Munkvold & Volkoff's six‐step framework, a hybrid approach that melds concepts from existing critical realism models with the idea of affordances. The findings suggest that data demand and supply mechanisms are critical in institutionalising KODI and that, underpinning basic data‐related affordances, are mechanisms engaging with institutional capacity, formal policy, and political support. It is the absence of such elements in the Kenya case which explains why it has experienced significant delays.",20181101,"Mungai, Paul W.",Article,Academic Journal,Nov2018,true,Electronic Journal of Information Systems in Developing Countries,Kenya ; Transparency in government ; Critical realism ; Supply & demand,JOUR,,,1681-4835,,,,,eng,Wiley-Blackwell,13,1,13,84,6,10.1002/isd2.12056,,1D48,,https://research.ebsco.com/linkprocessor/plink?id=2dd36506-95e2-359d-9677-f7d7d0787907

The similarities in people's breakup practices between 2008 and 2018 reveal that, regardless of what social media is used, American undergraduates turn to media in moments of breakup as ways to manage three complicated aspects of ending a relationship: untangling all the ways in which people signal intertwined lives, deciphering the quotidian unknowable of another person's mind, and trying to control who knows what when. This paper explores how rapid shifts in media ecologies may change the ways in which conventionalization around social practices emerges, leading to more norms oriented around what all media accomplish, rather than generating norms around the affordances of a specific medium.",20201001,"Gershon, Ilana",Article,Academic Journal,Oct-Dec2020,true,Information Society,Social media ; Computer assisted language instruction ; Ecology,JOUR,,,0197-2243,,,,,eng,Taylor & Francis Ltd,289,279,11,36,5,10.1080/01972243.2020.1798316,,1HQ,,https://research.ebsco.com/linkprocessor/plink?id=d3129385-24e3-3fc6-8050-6932624249e4
"Library, Information Science & Technology Abstracts",lxh,146318503,Digital contagion: Measuring spillover in an Internet mobilization campaign.,"The effects of microtargeted digital advertisements intended to mobilize voters have the unique potential to spread within households through the sharing of devices. We conduct an analysis of cohabitants of individuals randomly assigned to receive microtargeted mobilization ads during a municipal election. Results show that digital ads generate a spillover effect, though the effect is moderated by district competitiveness. This contagion can occur whether the original subjects are mobilized or not, though there is a strong association between ads that mobilize their intended target and spread within the household. To explain these results, we advance a distinction between technological and social spillover, with the former grounded in the affordances of the medium of mobilization, and argue that our results are suggestive of both phenomena.",20201001,"Haenschen, Katherine ; Jennings, Jay",Article,Academic Journal,Oct-Dec2020,true,Journal of Information Technology & Politics,Internet ; Local elections ; Competition (Psychology) ; Political advertising ; Households,JOUR,,,1933-1681,,,,,eng,Taylor & Francis Ltd,391,376,16,17,4,10.1080/19331681.2020.1748786,,3AFS,,https://research.ebsco.com/linkprocessor/plink?id=1566148b-11f0-31c2-9dbb-bc613cd47005
"Library, Information Science & Technology Abstracts",lxh,146318526,Enacting chronic illness with and through digital media: a feminist new materialist approach.,"Few studies have sought to examine the ways in which people with chronic health conditions engage with digital health technologies across the full spectrum that is currently available. In this article, we present four illustrative vignettes based on interviews with women with chronic conditions who participated in the Australian Women and Digital Health Project. The vignettes show how these women used mobile apps and online resources to find and share information and support, monitor their bodies and health states and self-manage their conditions. We draw on the theoretical approach of feminist new materialism to identify the affordances (of human bodies and of technologies), relational connections, affective forces and agential capacities generated with and through our participants' use of digital media. Our study highlights the important role played by both digital and non-digital encounters and actors. The vignettes demonstrate the complexities of entanglements between human sensory embodied experiences, face-to-face encounters with other people and digitally-mediated experiences and social networks in configuring and enacting lay expertise and self-management of chronic health conditions. The vignettes show 'what a body can do' when people living with chronic illnesses are actively engaged with the possibilities of digital health technologies available to them. They also highlight the limitations of some digital media – particularly apps – and the ways in which the design of these applications can fall short of providing promised benefits to members of minority and marginalised social groups such as people with chronic illnesses.",20201001,"Maslen, Sarah ; Lupton, Deborah",Article,Academic Journal,Oct2020,true,"Information, Communication & Society",Digital media ; Chronic diseases ; Mobile health ; Human body & technology ; Australians ; Medical technology ; Vignettes,JOUR,,,1369-118X,,,,,eng,Taylor & Francis Ltd,1654,1640,15,23,11,10.1080/1369118X.2019.1602665,,5BA,,https://research.ebsco.com/linkprocessor/plink?id=bfe73ae0-6ca1-3945-bff3-429ac3bf5844

The study adopts the interactionist model of disability and problematises conceptual uniformity in research that focuses on the medical and socially-constructed features of disability as those determining digital constraints and affordances for PwD. Through primary qualitative evidence, it argues that individuality and selectiveness shape a complex terrain of intra-disability diversity, which forms the nuances and experiences of digital inclusion for PwD. Thus, it invites researchers to move beyond disability-fixed categorisations and offers a 3-tier recommendation for future research to explain the range of PwD' perceptions and experiences in the digital realm.",20200901,"Tsatsou, Panayiota",Article,Academic Journal,Sep2020,true,Behaviour & Information Technology,Cluster analysis (Statistics) ; Focus groups ; Information technology ; Internet ; Qualitative research ; Digital divide ; United Kingdom ; People with disabilities ; Cultural pluralism ; Research funding ; Social integration ; Accessible design of public spaces ; Data analysis software,JOUR,,,0144-929X,,,,,eng,Taylor & Francis Ltd,1010,995,16,39,9,10.1080/0144929X.2019.1636136,,B6Q,,https://research.ebsco.com/linkprocessor/plink?id=09bf07e2-371a-3b95-bded-e367f7b5dc17

Whether this type of digital mediation changes the lived experience is of interest in this article. The intention is to show that besides changing the prevailing practices and behaviour, new technologies also enhance and add positive value to the everyday urban experience. This positive experiential value is approached with the framework consisting of recent advances in philosophical urban and everyday aesthetics, which put emphasis on both familiarity and fun as important qualities that describe the everyday experience in urban environments. We claim that new digital tools increase the quality of fun when moving in familiar surroundings. Fun, understood through the lens of the aesthetic, precedes the experienced quality of playfulness. It alters the existing affordances of the urban environment in a way that make more complex aesthetic qualities emerge. The case examples are GPS-based wayfinding applications such as route planners and navigation tools for pedestrian use and related AR applications such as the popular game app Pokémon GO.",20200601,"Lehtinen, Sanna ; Vihanninjoki, Vesa",Article,Academic Journal,Jun2020,true,Behaviour & Information Technology,Mobile apps ; Ecology ; Experience ; Games ; Global Positioning System ; Interpersonal relations ; Metropolitan areas ; Philosophy ; Play,JOUR,,,0144-929X,,,,,eng,Taylor & Francis Ltd,655,648,8,39,6,10.1080/0144929X.2019.1677776,,B6Q,,https://research.ebsco.com/linkprocessor/plink?id=5ea28301-bb47-36cd-8409-d764baf36e02

It is thus important to study the organisational structures and communication dynamics of these groups to provide insight into why they have been successful in recruiting members and how they further spread and normalise misogynistic beliefs. One such misogynistic group is MGTOW (Men Going Their Own Way). This study seeks to understand the structure and content of discussion within the forum of the official MGTOW website. To do so, it undertakes a content analysis of comments (n = 1012) inspired by Freelon's (2010, 2015) multi-norm approach to studying online communication, which draws on the liberal individual, communitarian and deliberative models. It also assesses the broader patterns of commenting (n = 628,745) participation amongst users (n = 33,863). The results suggest that debates on the forum combine elements of each communicative approach and that this reflects a contradiction in their underlying ideology of separation and individualism. In addition, it was found that topics of conversation primarily focused on two topics: women (the majority of which unfold in a misogynistic way) and defining MGTOW – both as a collective identity and a personal journey.",20200601,"Wright, Scott ; Trott, Verity ; Jones, Callum",Article,Academic Journal,Jun2020,true,"Information, Communication & Society",Internet forums ; Content analysis ; Self ; Social groups ; Group identity ; Discourse ; Forums,JOUR,,,1369-118X,,,,,eng,Taylor & Francis Ltd,925,908,18,23,6,10.1080/1369118X.2020.1751867,,5BA,,https://research.ebsco.com/linkprocessor/plink?id=7c7b6d86-20f1-36b3-ab53-88c540161953

Although they are well studied in the literature, little research examines how sociotechnical design changes influence the sustainability of support communities for different medical conditions. We compare the impact of a single design change on 49 disease‐specific health support forums hosted on the WebMD platform, a popular online health information service. A statistical analysis showcases changes in posting patterns before and after the design intervention; a subsequent interpretive examination of forum content reveals how the design change affected members' perceived affordances of the platform. Our findings suggest that, despite differences between communities, the design change triggered a common set of cascading effects: it made it difficult for core users to create and maintain relationships, that led them to ultimately leave the site, and, in turn, reduced the activity drawing newcomers to the platform. Using these findings, we argue that the design of sustainable and robust online communities must account for systemic, sociotechnical dynamics.",20200401,"Introne, Joshua ; Erickson, Ingrid ; Semaan, Bryan ; Goggins, Sean",Article,Academic Journal,Apr2020,true,Journal of the Association for Information Science & Technology,Internet ; Web development ; User interfaces ; World Wide Web ; United States ; Chronic diseases ; Communities ; Interpersonal relations ; Regression analysis ; Social networks ; Time series analysis ; Social support,JOUR,,,2330-1635,,,,,eng,Wiley-Blackwell,394,379,16,71,4,10.1002/asi.24250,,H6JN,,https://research.ebsco.com/linkprocessor/plink?id=228905a3-8316-3696-827f-6d7270e5fe26

However, a lack of understanding about it limits the optimization of its potential. Hence, this paper aims to assess the role of hedonic motivation, network externalities (NE) and top management support in conjugation with the unified theory of acceptance and use of technology theory to understand ESN's usage for knowledge sharing. Design/methodology/approach: Data were collected from 187 ESN users through a survey questionnaire and subsequently analyzed using variance-based structural equation modeling using the partial least squares method. Findings: ESNs are used both for utilitarian and hedonic purposes. Furthermore, the results also bring out the importance of externalities arising from an extensive network of users and complimentary services, as well as support regarding resources and recognition from the top management toward reinforcing the benefits of using ESNs. Research limitations/implications: This study advances earlier knowledge by assessing the actual usage of ESNs for knowledge sharing. It takes into consideration multiple input variables, namely, performance expectancy, effort expectancy, NE amongst others to best resonate with the key factors driving its adoption and usage by an individual. However, because of the cross-sectional research design, causality can only be inferred. Practical implications: The organizations are recommended to have in place the measures for attaining optimal usage of ESNs, and in turn, witness knowledge moves around in ways unfathomable. Steps should be taken to develop tools and ecosystems to provide users affordances for both increasing productivity, as well as opportunities for gaining pleasure. Originality/value: This study is one of its kind effort to synthesize the knowledge about the ESNs in an Indian context.

"Library, Information Science & Technology Abstracts",lxh,142411984,Deconstructing the data life-cycle in digital humanitarianism.,"The role that technologies have historically played in producing and reproducing global inequalities is well documented. Although technological innovation is associated with progress that does not mean that it necessarily narrows the gap between rich and poor, instead technological inequalities tend to exacerbate other inequalities. This applies also to information and communication technologies (ICT) and Big Data, which play an increasingly important role in humanitarianism. In this article, we address the socio-technical work that is necessary to acquire, process, store and use data and study the power relations that are embedded in these processes. We focus in particular on the use of Big Data in digital humanitarianism and argue that at each stage of the digital data life-cycle (data acquisition, data processing, data storage, and data usage and decision making) different resources are required. These include not only access to hardware, software and connectivity but also the ability to make use of the affordances of digital technologies. We posit that in the context of humanitarianism, ICT and Big Data are a particularly intriguing to study due to their ambivalent position of seeking to address inequalities while at the same time perpetuating them.",20200401,"Roth, Silke ; Luczak-Roesch, Markus",Article,Academic Journal,Apr2020,true,"Information, Communication & Society",Digital technology ; Big data ; Information & communication technologies ; Electronic data processing ; Data warehousing ; Humanitarianism,JOUR,,,1369-118X,,,,,eng,Taylor & Francis Ltd,571,555,17,23,4,10.1080/1369118X.2018.1521457,,5BA,,https://research.ebsco.com/linkprocessor/plink?id=600471eb-0b61-3a1d-b054-6a0a68d363aa
"Library, Information Science & Technology Abstracts",lxh,141097042,Visual cross-platform analysis: digital methods to research social media images.,"Analysis of social media using digital methods is a flourishing approach. However, the relatively easy availability of data collected via platform application programming interfaces has arguably led to the predominance of single-platform research of social media. Such research has also privileged the role of text in social media analysis, as a form of data that is more readily gathered and searchable than images. In this paper, we challenge both of these prevailing forms of social media research by outlining a methodology for visual cross-platform analysis (VCPA), defined as the study of still and moving images across two or more social media platforms. Our argument contains three steps. First, we argue that cross-platform analysis addresses a gap in research methods in that it acknowledges the interplay between a social phenomenon under investigation and the medium within which it is being researched, thus illuminating the different affordances and cultures of web platforms. Second, we build on the literature on multimodal communication and platform vernacular to provide a rationale for incorporating the visual into cross-platform analysis. Third, we reflect on an experimental cross-platform analysis of images within social media posts (n = 471,033) used to communicate climate change to advance different modes of macro- and meso-levels of analysis that are natively visual: image-text networks, image plots and composite images.

The purpose of this paper is to contribute in the ongoing theorisation of information literacy by exploring the meaning and implications of the emergent grounded theory of mitigating risk for information literacy research and practice. Design/methodology/approach: The grounded theory was produced through a qualitative study that was framed by practice theory and the theoretical constructs of cognitive authority and affordance, and employed constructivist grounded theory, semi-structured interviews and photo-elicitation methods to explore the information literacy practices of language-learners overseas. Findings: This paper provides a theoretically rich exploration of language-learner information literacy practices while further identifying the importance of time, affect and information creation within information literacy research and practice as well as the need for the continued theorisation of information literacy concepts. Research limitations/implications: The paper's constructivist grounded theorisation of information literacy remains localised and contextualised rather than generalisable.

"Library, Information Science & Technology Abstracts",lxh,141104978,Conceptualizing information work for health contexts in Library and Information Science.,"Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to suggest that a closer consideration of the notion of work and, more specifically, information work as a sensitizing concept in Library and Information Science (LIS) can offer a helpful way to differently consider how people interact and engage with information and can complement a parallel focus on practices, behaviours and activities. Design/methodology/approach: Starting with the advent of the concept of information work in Corbin and Strauss' work, the paper then summarizes how information work has evolved and taken shape in LIS research and discourse, both within and outside of health-related information contexts. Findings: The paper argues that information work affords a lens that can acknowledge the multiple levels of effort and multiple processes (cognitive, physical or social-behavioural) related to information activities. This paper outlines six affordances that the use of information work within LIS scholarship imparts: acknowledges the conceptual, mental and affective; brings attention to the invisibility of particular information activities and their constituents; opens up and distinguishes the many different lines of work; destabilizes hierarchies between professionals and non-professionals; emphasizes goals relating to information activities and their underlying pursuits; and questions work/non-work dichotomies established in existing LIS models. Originality/value: This paper is a first in bringing together the many iterations of information work research in LIS. In doing so, this paper serves as a prompt for other LIS scholars to take up, challenge the existing borders of, and thus advance the concept of information work.",20200101,"Dalmer, Nicole K. ; Huvila, Isto",Article,Academic Journal,2020,true,Journal of Documentation,Information science ; Library science ; Information modeling ; Invisibility,JOUR,,,0022-0418,,,,,eng,Emerald Publishing Limited,108,96,13,76,1,10.1108/JD-03-2019-0055,,GRF,,https://research.ebsco.com/linkprocessor/plink?id=f4f24c62-05bb-32ab-9a52-a88f3a6b511e
"Library, Information Science & Technology Abstracts",lxh,142288038,Why are some websites researched more than others? A review of research into the global top twenty.,"The web is central to the work and social lives of a substantial fraction of the world's population, but the role of popular websites may not always be subject to academic scrutiny. This is a concern if social scientists are unable to understand an aspect of users' daily lives because one or more major websites have been ignored. To test whether popular websites may be ignored in academia, this article assesses the volume and citation impact of research mentioning any of twenty major websites. The results are consistent with the user geographic base affecting research interest and citation impact. In addition, site affordances that are useful for research also influence academic interest. Because of the latter factor, however, it is not possible to estimate the extent of academic knowledge about a site from the number of publications that mention it. Nevertheless, the virtual absence of international research about some globally important Chinese and Russian websites is a serious limitation for those seeking to understand reasons for their web success, the markets they serve or the users that spend time on them.

"Library, Information Science & Technology Abstracts",lxh,139809372,Considering the local and the translocal: Reframing health information practice research using institutional ethnography.,"Purpose: Institutional ethnography is a method of inquiry that brings attention to people's everyday work while simultaneously highlighting broader sites of administration and governance that may be organising that work. The purpose of this paper is to argue that the integration of institutional ethnography in health information practice research represents an important shift in the way that Library and Information Science professionals and researchers study and understand these practices. Design/methodology/approach: This paper first explores the key tenets and conceptual underpinnings of Dorothy Smith's institutional ethnography, illuminating the importance of moving between translocal and the local contexts and identifying ruling relations. Drawing from a library and information science study that combined interviews and textual analyses to examine the social organisation of family caregivers' health-related information work, the paper then explores the affordances of starting in the local particularities and then moving outwards to the translocal. Findings: The paper concludes with an overall assessment of what institutional ethnography can contribute to investigations of health information practices. By pushing from the local to the translocal, institutional ethnography enables a questioning of existing library and information science conceptualisations of context and of reappraising the everyday-life information seeking work/non-work dichotomy. Ultimately, in considering both the local and the translocal, institutional ethnography casts a wider net on understanding individuals' health information practices.

This research uses Social Exchange Theory and the impression management (IM) literature to examine how privacy concerns can be counterbalanced by the perceived social benefits afforded by a social network’s ability to support IM. We frame social network use as an attempt to engage in IM, and we highlight the importance of a social network’s IM affordances in predicting social benefits from, and disclosure through, a social network. We test our model with a sample of 244 Facebook users, finding support for the proposed relationships and yielding the following contributions. First, this research provides a novel positioning of perceived IM affordances as a primary driver of both perceived social benefits and IM disclosure propensity. Second, this research illuminates that trust in both the social network provider and social network peers influences privacy concerns, social benefits, and perceived IM affordances.

This paper discusses how ultrarunners create, use, and share embodied information on Instagram. The research explores how embodied information is used beyond the run, asking how visual social media digital practices shape how information is created, used, and shared. Method. Immersive observation of the ultrarunning community on Instagram was used to explore the use of embodied information. Analysis. Ethnographic data was analysed as an iterative and reflexive process. Data collection, analysis, and writing are intertwined processes in the research design. Results. The visual affordances of Instagram allow embodied information to be created, used and shared. Six genres of information about ultrarunning, which incorporate embodied information using visual media, are identified. Embodied information relating to the key genres of ultrarunning is shared using on the run video, live broadcasts, photographs of kit and data infographics. Conclusion. The paper contributes to the body of knowledge about embodied information by providing insight into how visual social media affordances support the creation, use, and sharing of embodied information.",20240401,"Williams, Laura ; Cox, Andrew ; Jimenez, Andrea",Article,Academic Journal,2024,true,Information Research,Information sharing ; Social media ; Photographs ; Data analysis ; Instagram (Web resource),JOUR,,,1368-1613,,,,,eng,University of Boras,18,18,1,29,2,10.47989/ir292853,,EB6,,https://research.ebsco.com/linkprocessor/plink?id=12733494-2ad6-3be3-8388-cd178f28d65d

During this time, political content became largely ubiquitous across the app. Politics play out daily on TikTok, as individuals craft messages within the technological affordances and sociocultural dynamics of the app. This study expands on research regarding civic engagement in digital public spheres by examining and describing how TikTok shapes political expression and discourse through three technological affordances on the app: the Green Screen, the Stitch, and the Duet. While these affordances are often hailed as features that bolster user creativity through increased possible interactions, our analysis found these increased possible interactions to be highly specific, and also limited in conjunction with politics.

We report the findings of a research investigating the use of social media in conjunction with digital image collections, by Australian cultural institutions, with a focus on the results relating to historical societies. The theory of technology affordances was applied to better understand Australian cultural institutions' use of social media in relation to digital image collections. Method. Data collection was conducted in two phases: seventy Websites maintained by mainstream institutions and community archives were examined and their features mapped; and interviews were conducted with staff and volunteers with responsibility for social media in a range of cultural institutions. Analysis. Qualitative analysis was carried out on the results of the interviews and the data then analysed to identify a series of affordances in relation to the cultural institutions' use of social media. Results. The project identified nine affordances associated with the stated aims and use of social media, and issues that impact on the realisation of those affordances. Conclusion. The findings from the Australian historical societies are highlighted, demonstrating that there is little consistency in their attitudes towards digital image collections and use of social media, and that many struggle to realise the potential benefits associated with utilising these platforms.",20171201,"Ruge, Courtney ; Denison, Tom",Article,Academic Journal,Dec2017,true,Information Research,Social media ; Digital media ; Communication ; History associations ; Societies,JOUR,,,1368-1613,,,,,eng,University of Boras,17,1,17,22,4,,,EB6,,https://research.ebsco.com/linkprocessor/plink?id=b3a4f48c-65f6-36aa-8726-f442b5e1b1ac

As web text is one of the extensively used elements in online learning, this study aims to derive practical guidelines on this aspect by exploring the experience of learners with dyslexia and learners without dyslexia when using different online reading affordances. The study employed a within-subjects qualitative study and key patterns that emerged from the data collected via observations and interviews were interpreted based on two important aspects of learning experience, which were perceived learning and engagement. The study reveals that (1) the direct application of Printed Text on the web should be carefully considered, (2) existing web accessibility guidelines (limit to guidelines examined in this study) are appropriate and (3) the use of a Screen Reader for online reading should not be made compulsory and be available as an option instead. The comparison between the experience of learners with and without dyslexia in this study has yielded insights into affordances that are perceived positively by both groups of learners. As learners with dyslexia form a significant minority of the online learning population, the inclusive dyslexia-friendly guidelines derived from this study would better inform the future implementation of online reading affordances that acknowledge differences and similarities between online learners.",20171101,"Chen, Chwen ; Keong, Melissa",Article,Academic Journal,Nov2017,true,Universal Access in the Information Society,Distance education ; Online education ; Dyslexia ; Classroom environment ; Guidelines,JOUR,,,1615-5289,,,,,eng,Springer Nature,965,951,15,16,4,10.1007/s10209-016-0501-0,,O75,,https://research.ebsco.com/linkprocessor/plink?id=4edc4e6d-04cd-35ef-9219-35edd6d6bccf

"Library, Information Science & Technology Abstracts",lxh,108795522,Convenience matters: A qualitative study on the impact of use of social media and collaboration technologies on learning experience and performance in higher education.,"Social media and collaboration technologies are viewed as valuable tools for creating a new reality of collaborative learning, particularly in higher education facing millennials growing up with various technologies in their daily lives. Using the example of an undergraduate course taught on-campus, this study examines how millennial students in higher education use social media and other collaboration technologies in their collaborative learning activities to co-create new knowledge through the application of existing knowledge and the sharing of ideas. A semi-structured survey-based qualitative research method is used to reveal the primary decision factors driving students' technology choice for use in their collaborative learning tasks and to assess the impact of the use of such technologies on their learning experience and performance. The analysis reveals convenience as an important decision factor impacting millennial students' choice of social media and collaborative technologies to use in their team-based collaborative learning interactions. In particular, the three salient types of convenience emerge that matter to millennial students: convenient to everybody in the team, convenient to access and use, and convenient to collaborate with each other privately within the team. The analysis suggests that the use of social media and collaboration technologies chosen by students in their collaborative learning activities is more likely to result in students with positive collaborative learning experience than otherwise. In addition, a moderately strong correlation (r = 0.425, p < 0.01) is found between students' learning performance and their perception on the impact of the use of the technologies of their choice on learning experience. Based on the analysis, this study proposes a student-engaged, technology-choice-and-impact framework that captures the relationship between millennial students' convenience-driven technology choice and its impact on collative learning experience and performance. Further efforts should focus on investigating pedagogic designs that engage students in technology choice for improved collaborative learning experience and performance. The results of this study can inform educators and education technology providers in tailoring their approaches to incorporating technologies with learners in mind, thus turning their engagement into improved learning experience and performance.",20140101,Yeona Jang,Article,Academic Journal,2014/2015,true,Education for Information,Social media ; Educational technology ; Learning ; Educational cooperation ; Higher education,JOUR,,,0167-8329,,,,,eng,Sage Publications Inc.,98,73,26,31,1/2,10.3233/EFI-150948,,EFI,,https://research.ebsco.com/linkprocessor/plink?id=67a74a3c-e61f-3e12-963a-acd9da3b75d0
"Library, Information Science & Technology Abstracts",lxh,138955317,On the impact of group size on collaborative search effectiveness.,"While today's web search engines are designed for single-user search, over the years research efforts have shown that complex information needs—which are explorative, open-ended and multi-faceted—can be answered more efficiently and effectively when searching in collaboration. Collaborative search (and sensemaking) research has investigated techniques, algorithms and interface affordances to gain insights and improve the collaborative search process. It is not hard to imagine that the size of the group collaborating on a search task significantly influences the group's behaviour and search effectiveness. However, a common denominator across almost all existing studies is a fixed group size—usually either pairs, triads or in a few cases four users collaborating. Investigations into larger group sizes and the impact of group size dynamics on users' behaviour and search metrics have so far rarely been considered—and when, then only in a simulation setup. In this work, we investigate in a large-scale user experiment to what extent those simulation results carry over to the real world. To this end, we extended our collaborative search framework SearchX with algorithmic mediation features and ran a large-scale experiment with more than 300 crowd-workers. We consider the collaboration group size as a dependent variable, and investigate collaborations between groups of up to six people. We find that most prior simulation-based results on the impact of collaboration group size on behaviour and search effectiveness cannot be reproduced in our user experiment.",20191001,"Moraes, Felipe ; Grashoff, Kilian ; Hauff, Claudia",Article,Academic Journal,Oct2019,true,Information Retrieval Journal,Web search engines ; Search engines ; Information needs ; Social groups ; Dependent variables,JOUR,,,1386-4564,,,,,eng,Springer Nature,498,476,23,22,5,10.1007/s10791-018-09350-9,,OG8,,https://research.ebsco.com/linkprocessor/plink?id=41cde409-70f5-303f-886b-5bf0b865248d
"Library, Information Science & Technology Abstracts",lxh,138320769,After the 'APIcalypse': social media platforms and their fight against critical scholarly research.,"In the aftermath of the Cambridge Analytica controversy, social media platform providers such as Facebook and Twitter have severely restricted access to platform data via their Application Programming Interfaces (APIs). This has had a particularly critical effect on the ability of social media researchers to investigate phenomena such as abuse, hate speech, trolling, and disinformation campaigns, and to hold the platforms to account for the role that their affordances and policies might play in facilitating such dysfunction. Alternative data access frameworks, such as Facebook's partnership with the controversial Social Science One initiative, represent an insufficient replacement for fully functional APIs, and the platform providers' actions in responding to the Cambridge Analytica scandal raise suspicions that they have instrumentalised it to actively frustrate critical, independent, public interest scrutiny by scholars. Building on a critical review of Facebook's public statements through its own platforms and the mainstream media, and of the scholarly responses these have drawn, this article outlines the societal implications of the 'APIcalypse', and reviews potential options for scholars in responding to it.",20191001,"Bruns, Axel",Article,Academic Journal,Oct2019,true,"Information, Communication & Society",Mass media ; Social media ; Disinformation ; Meta Platforms Inc. ; Cambridge Analytica Ltd. ; Social skills ; Hate speech ; Public interest,JOUR,,,1369-118X,,,,,eng,Taylor & Francis Ltd,1566,1544,23,22,11,10.1080/1369118X.2019.1637447,,5BA,,https://research.ebsco.com/linkprocessor/plink?id=a72ebf0b-cdad-3c72-9134-636e0b9081bd

"Library, Information Science & Technology Abstracts",lxh,135147249,Interactionism in the age of ubiquitous telecommunication.,"The following paper aims to engage recent reconsiderations of Gibson's theory of affordances and Goffman's concept of copresence in the context of the material turn - especially in the form expressed by Bruno Latour's actor-network theory. The paper's central claim is that microsociology cannot avoid engaging material turn theory. It will be argued that contemporary attempts to reconceptualize classical microsociological frameworks set out on a path that invariably leads to problems investigated by thinkers like Latour: as communication technology advances, the importance of mediated interaction grows, prompting attempts to update interactionism for non-face-to-face interactions such as teleconferencing, social networks and virtual reality. These new social situations are then made sense of in terms of the way these technologies have a transformative effect on interaction. This effect ‒ be it a modifier of the temporal structure of the interaction, or of the interactional capacity of the agents ‒ is argued to always lead back to a central question of the material turn: if technology is a static transformational effect, where is its agency? Or, conversely: if a technological object's effect is uniform across all external factors, how is that not a form of technological determinism? The paper investigates whether attempts to avoid determinism manage to keep Latourian metaphysics at bay. The paper concludes by suggesting that contemporary social theory must work towards a middle way that does not gloss over important contributions of material turn theorists whilst also not ignoring the importance of considering human political responsibility.",20190501,"Klowait, Nils Oliver",Article,Academic Journal,May2019,true,"Information, Communication & Society",Ubiquitous computing ; Telecommunication ; Actor-network theory ; Microsociology ; Mediation,JOUR,,,1369-118X,,,,,eng,Taylor & Francis Ltd,621,605,17,22,5,10.1080/1369118X.2019.1566487,,5BA,,https://research.ebsco.com/linkprocessor/plink?id=7d36389e-1c45-3ceb-a8a6-1b8b90b2fb27
"Library, Information Science & Technology Abstracts",lxh,134106095,The opportunity to contribute: disability and the digital entrepreneur.,"A range of scholarly work in communications, informatics, and media studies has identified 'entrepreneurs' as central to an emerging paradigm of digital labor. Drawing on data from a multi-year research project in the virtual world Second Life, I explore disability experiences of entrepreneurism, focusing on intersections of creativity, risk, and inclusion. Since its founding in 2003, Second Life has witnessed significant disability participation. Many such residents engage in forms of entrepreneurship that destabilize dominant understandings of digital labor. Most make little or no profit; some labor at a loss. Something is being articulated through languages and practices of entrepreneurship, something that challenges the ableist paradigms that still deeply structure both digital socialities and conceptions of labor. Disability is typically assumed to be incompatible with work, an assumption often reinforced by policies that withdraw benefits from disabled persons whose income exceeds a meagre threshold. Responses to such exclusion appear when disabled persons in Second Life frame 'entrepreneur' as a selfhood characterized by creativity and contribution, not just initiative and risk. In navigating structural barriers with regard to income and access, including affordances of the virtual world itself, they implicitly contest reconfigurations of personhood under neoliberalism, where the laboring self becomes framed not as a worker earning an hourly wage, but as a business with the 'ability' to sell services. This reveals how digital technology reworks the interplay of selfhood, work, and value - but in ways that remain culturally specific and embedded in forms of inequality.",20190401,"Boellstorff, Tom",Article,Academic Journal,Apr2019,true,"Information, Communication & Society",Digital technology ; Technological innovations ; Social media ; Virtual reality ; Entrepreneurship,JOUR,,,1369-118X,,,,,eng,Taylor & Francis Ltd,490,474,17,22,4,10.1080/1369118X.2018.1472796,,5BA,,https://research.ebsco.com/linkprocessor/plink?id=e91eaa68-aa06-3acf-adad-313c8154c288
"Library, Information Science & Technology Abstracts",lxh,135388177,Duality of self-promotion on social networking sites.,"Purpose Self-promotion on social networking sites (SNSs) is a controversial issue as it has been attributed to various positive and negative consequences. To better understand the reasons for the mixed consequences and the nature of self-promotion on SNSs, the purpose of this paper is to theorize and empirically investigate the duality of SNS self-promotion and its underlying socio-psychological mechanisms.Design/methodology/approach By drawing on the motivational affordance lens and self-determination theory, this study develops a theoretical account of the duality of self-promotion on SNSs. The author places subjective vitality and SNS addiction as the positive and negative consequences of self-promotion. The model was tested using partial least squares technique with data collected from 289 Finnish Facebook users using a survey.Findings The results show that self-promotion contributes to both subjective vitality and to SNS addiction. Importantly, exhibitionism attenuates the effect of self-promotion on subjective vitality and amplifies the effect of self-promotion on SNS addiction. The feature-level analysis shows that status updates, adding photos, commenting in others' posts and profile completeness are the main determinants of self-promotion. Status updates, adding photos and check-ins, in turn, have high exhibitionistic appeal.Originality/value To date, the empirical attempts to investigate the duality of SNS use have been rare. In particular, prior research is largely silent in explaining what tilt the outcomes of self-promotion either toward positive or negative direction. The paper fills this theoretical and empirical gap and thus contributes to literature on dualities of SNS use.",20190401,"Islam, A. K. M.

In general, life quality of the patients will be improved since they will have more agency over their disease. Once they enter the analysis results on the system set up, they can have direct access to the relevant data so they can have agency over their course of disease, which render them more aware and informed patients. The secondary benefit would be concerned with the psychological aspect since agency and more awareness would help reduce anxiety and concerns regarding the disease. Highlights • The study suggests a relevant solution that is Knowledge-based Oriented Stroke Diagnosis Healthcare Application for cardioembolic/cryptogenic stroke patients. • The study includes big data application, supported by ANN, it has been used on all mobile phone running Android OS with cloud computing for the first time concerning Stroke dataset. • The proposed system will enhance accessibility to accurate health data and analysis for the patients, • The system will also improve the accuracy rate since classification is performed by ANN clustering affordance. • The system will serve to provide economic benefits since the information is accessed directly through mobile system of the user. • Overall, the life quality of the Stroke patients will increase as a result of using the proposed novel system. Abstract Information technology has recently seen a huge progress in innovative healthcare technologies that rendered healthcare data bigger. Connectivity on 7/24 basis between human to device and device to device have a crucial role in individuals' lives. Therefore, Mobile Cloud System (MCC) has become an indispensable tool. Parallel with the rapid developments in the Internet of Things, convergence has become an important issue. Our proposed method, accordingly, can be converged with mobile-cloud environments with cloud computing in handling healthcare information. This study uses Virtual Dedicated Server (VDS) as 4 VCPU and 8 GB RAM and proposes a model based on the Android based mobile phones for stroke patients with cardioembolic (689) and cryptogenic (528) subtypes. The system set up through this study has two basic application elements which are mobile application and server application. Artificial Neural Network (ANN) module is beneficial for classifying the two stroke subtypes while server application is used for saving the data from the patients. Accordingly, our model guarantees availability, security, and scalability as a system for stroke patients applying Stroke dataset for ANN algorithm, Multilayer Perceptron Algorithm (MLP), which has been done for the first time in literature with big data in this scope. The main contributions are: (1) The outcomes will display an individual unique social insurance framework. (2) The outcomes will be utilized for the distinguishing proof of stroke-related data to be gathered by cell phones that are Android based. (3) Stroke patients will find out about their condition of well-being through an ANN application programming interface, which will provide a sort of organization for the patients. Overall, an efficient and user-friendly stroke determination human services framework has been presented through this Healthcare System for patients.",20190401,"Karaca, Yeliz ; Moonis, Majaz ; Zhang, Yu-Dong ; Gezgez, Caner",Article,Academic Journal,Apr2019,true,International Journal of Information Management,Cloud computing ; Mobile computing ; Multilayer perceptrons ; Android (Operating system),JOUR,,,0268-4012,,,,,eng,Elsevier B.V.,261,250,12,45,,10.1016/j.ijinfomgt.2018.09.012,,1LL,,https://research.ebsco.com/linkprocessor/plink?id=df702827-aefc-37bf-80b0-25e6edeaf8cd

The objective of the paper was to examine whether mobile phone ownership facilitates the work of some micro-entrepreneurs and constrains the work of others. In addition, the paper examines the situation of those who were exploiting the 'spillover efficiencies' of mobile telephony by borrowing (sometimes for pay) the phones of others. The findings of this study suggest that the early adopters reap efficiency benefits while those who lag behind have a weaker position. The paper also examines examples of some small-scale 'sideline' activities enabled by the mobile phone, e.g., phone owners selling air-time to non-owners.

More importantly, each language embodies its place and associated world view. This paper looks at how information technology (IT) is supporting knowledge-sharing through approaches used in Indigenous community IT practice and projects to enhance multimedia repositories of knowledge. The origin of any archive is important, in terms of access and control of the use of this material, but also it is important in teaching, to provide the context and connectedness when presenting the material. A collection of knowledge resources can be used to recreate online flexible learning environments around engineering on country and traditional knowledge practices. IT can provide an interactive interface for people wishing to learn the material, through games or worksheet-style activities. Various case studies and their analysis illustrate the way IT can be used to share this knowledge in a legitimate manner across landscapes and cultures. In particular the aim is to understand how authentic this approach can be in view of concerns over appropriation or co-option of Aboriginal knowledge.",20190301,"Kutay, Cat",Article,Academic Journal,Mar2019,true,Archives & Manuscripts,Information technology ; Institutional repositories ; Archives administration ; Traditional knowledge ; Aboriginal Australians ; Language maintenance,JOUR,,,0157-6895,,,,,eng,Australian Society of Archivists,93,72,22,47,1,10.1080/01576895.2018.1551143,,W6Q,,https://research.ebsco.com/linkprocessor/plink?id=aa98f5be-37a8-3f42-88ef-11b300cb38e8

Although quantitative numeric data on the use of social networking sites is plentiful, present research lacks qualitative data describing how these websites are used and experienced. This article describes research on the online experiences and interactions by Last.fm users. Last.fm is a website combining a music recommendation service, an online community and an online radio. We conducted in-depth face-to-face interviews with Last.fm users and observed their Last.fm profiles. Based on the aggregated data we suggest that most people use Last.fm as a tool, interacting heavily with the website itself, but much less with music. Interaction amongst Last.fm users seems to be sparse and superficial. Nevertheless, some respondents reported a 'sense of community' and referred to Last.fm as a tavern where one can converse about music, suggesting similarities with Ray Oldenburg's 'third places' or 'great good places'.",20110401,"Mechant, Peter ; Evens, Tom",Article,Academic Journal,2011,true,International Journal of Web Based Communities,Communication & technology ; Internet ; Web 2.0 ; Virtual communities ; Online social networks ; Web-based user interfaces,JOUR,,,1477-8394,,,,,eng,Inderscience Enterprises Ltd.,249,234,16,7,2,10.1504/IJWBC.2011.039513,,RW6,,https://research.ebsco.com/linkprocessor/plink?id=c5f00bc7-8ec3-3b5c-b3d2-3af9d55914de
"Library, Information Science & Technology Abstracts",lxh,123827938,Creating caring institutions for community informatics.,"This paper explores the potential affordances of applying a feminist ethics of care approach to community informatics practices in public internet access facilities. As feminist technology scholars have long observed, technology and technoculture are strongly encoded as masculine, privileging traits such as scientific knowledge, rationality, objectivity, and distance. These characteristics are expressed in traditional infomediary practices in a variety of ways, including notions of expertise, ways of conceptualizing technology, emphasis on skills attainment, and deficit-based models of user behavior. In contrast, ethics of care emphasizes the importance of relational and situated knowledge, pluralistic voices and experiences, and relationships bound by mutual interdependence. Traditionally, caring has been feminized and thus necessarily excluded from technoculture and relegated to invisible and unpaid labor. Caring and associated affective labor practices remain an under-examined subject in infomediary practices. Public libraries and community technology centers are logical places to explore for care work, given that they share many characteristics of the spaces where care work has historically been performed. We argue that an ethics of care framework has several possible affordances for infomediary practices in these institutions, including highlighting the gendered power dynamics that define and shape existing practices; distributing care work and making existing care work visible; and envisioning a more holistic and ethical approach to engaging diverse publics. We translate Tronto’s seven warning signs for ‘bad care’ in institutions into seven positive guidelines for providing ‘good care’ in public internet access facilities, then contextualize these for community informatics institutions and practices.",20171001,"Sweeney, Miriam E. ; Rhinesmith, Colin",Article,Academic Journal,Oct2017,true,"Information, Communication & Society",Community informatics ; Feminist ethics ; Techno culture ; Communities ; Gender,JOUR,,,1369-118X,,,,,eng,Taylor & Francis Ltd,1497,1482,16,20,10,10.1080/1369118X.2016.1234635,,5BA,,https://research.ebsco.com/linkprocessor/plink?id=b6fedb62-42a9-30cb-8823-1280ef9971d2

In the academic domains, indications are that knowledge patterns continue to reflect physically based geopolitical realities – where knowledge from the South is still peripheral while knowledge from the North still dominates in terms of all the conventional metrics. This study explores the potential role of digital affordances to challenge structural Northern bias and generates questions about knowledge production and dissemination in the climate change knowledge domain. It is framed by the field of scholarly communication within an African setting and by the emergent field of climate change which is fraught with debates and contestations, particularly regarding mitigation and adaptation. It draws on Southern theory which interrogates the global dynamics of knowledge production and dissemination. It explores the intersection of the discoverability and visibility of local climate change research methodologically from the outside in, through an experiment of searches for ‘climate change/South Africa’ and from the inside out by reviewing the online presence of one climate change group in a top-ranked African university.",20170301,"Czerniewicz, Laura ; Goodier, Sarah ; Morrell, Robert",Article,Academic Journal,Mar2017,true,"Information, Communication & Society",Information technology ; Digital communications ; Digital media ; Technology ; Climate change,JOUR,,,1369-118X,,,,,eng,Taylor & Francis Ltd,405,386,20,20,3,10.1080/1369118X.2016.1168473,,5BA,,https://research.ebsco.com/linkprocessor/plink?id=a375610f-a33d-3b66-afb7-0c90275af6b7

Drawing on conventional information systems (IS), human-computer interaction (HCI), ecological psychology and sociology and building on existing work on situated information systems, this article explores the idea of obtaining information from the environment to accomplish workplace activity in a routine way. A typology of conceptually distinct sources of information is presented and this has implications for what we understand information systems to be. Just as Hutchins (1995) refers to his conception of cognition as 'cognition in the wild', so we can conceive of situated information systems 'in the wild' rather than confined to computational space. The argument with respect to information systems analysis and design is that abstract representations should not be the only option considered.

"Library, Information Science & Technology Abstracts",lxh,35275761,Towards an account of intuitiveness.,"Intuitive systems are usable systems. Design guidelines advocate intuitiveness and vendors claim it - but what does it mean for a user interface, interactive system, or device to be intuitive? A review of the use of the term 'intuitive' indicates that it has two distinct but overlapping meanings, namely intuitiveness based on familiarity and intuitiveness reflecting our embodiment (and frequently both). While everyday usage indicates that familiarity means either a passing acquaintance or an intimacy with something or someone, it will be concluded that familiarity might best be equated with 'know-how', which in turn is based on a deep, often tacit, understanding. The intuitive nature of tangible user interfaces will in turn be attributed to embodiment rather than tangibility per se. Merleau-Ponty writes that it is through our bodies that we 'prehend' the world. A number of disciplines now regard action-perception as so closely coupled that they are better considered as a dyad rather than separately. A modified treatment of action-perception coupling is proposed, with familiarity providing an epistemic core, as the basis of intuitiveness.",20081101,"Turner, Phil",Article,Academic Journal,Nov/Dec2008,true,Behaviour & Information Technology,User interfaces ; Intuition ; Comprehension ; Sensory perception ; Discipline,JOUR,,,0144-929X,,,,,eng,Taylor & Francis Ltd,482,475,8,27,6,10.1080/01449290701292330,,B6Q,,https://research.ebsco.com/linkprocessor/plink?id=5465fcc1-c6a8-3b37-849a-07e40072d6c3

In the spirit of bridging mass and interpersonal processes, a model of interactivity is proposed to initiate discussion about the concept as a cross-level and multivalent phenomenon—one with both positive and negative consequences—and to spur more socially relevant research.

"Library, Information Science & Technology Abstracts",lxh,131498888,Exploring youth information-seeking behaviour and mobile technologies through a secondary analysis of qualitative data.,"This paper examines issues associated with secondary analysis of qualitative data and their implications for information behaviour scholarship. Secondary data analysis poses a range of potential challenges for data creators, but also opportunities, including the ability to expand theory to a wider context, strengthen the reliability and validity of existing theory, gain access to populations that may be difficult to access, and to promote data archiving. The paper uses as a case study of secondary data analysis the results from our re-examination of data gathered previously in the European Union project Net Children Go Mobile, drawing from the interview transcripts from the 34 children in the UK data set.

"Library, Information Science & Technology Abstracts",lxh,128358418,#IAmNotAfraidToSayIt: stories of sexual violence as everyday political speech on Facebook.,"The debate about the power and influence of networked publics often focuses on large-scale political events, activist campaigns and protest activity - the more visible forms of political engagement. On the other hand, digitally mediated activism is often questioned and sometimes derided as a lesser form of dissent, as it is easier to engage in, highly affective, and offers few assurances of sustainability of the change it calls for. But what about everyday political speech online, where social media platforms can contribute to a personalisation of politics? Can social media users express their views online and make a difference? This paper analyses around 3500 Facebook posts stemming from the #ЯНеБоюсьСказати (Ukrainian for #IAmNotAfraidToSayIt) online campaign that was started in the Ukrainian segment of Facebook in July 2016 by a local activist to raise awareness of how widespread sexual violence and sexual harassment are in the Ukrainian society. The paper argues that networked conversations about everyday rights and affective stories about shared experiences of injustice, underpinned by the affordances of social media platforms for sharing and discussing information and participating in everyday politics, can emerge as viable forms of networked feminist activism and can have real impact on the discursive status quo of an issue, both in the digital sphere and beyond it.",20180601,"Lokot, Tetyana",Article,Academic Journal,Jun2018,true,"Information, Communication & Society",Ukraine ; Sexual assault ; Political oratory ; Internet & activism ; Feminism ; Facebook (Web resource),JOUR,,,1369-118X,,,,,eng,Taylor & Francis Ltd,817,802,16,21,6,10.1080/1369118X.2018.1430161,,5BA,,https://research.ebsco.com/linkprocessor/plink?id=c959971c-4fbf-30c2-88cb-6f99641fca24

A combination of design decisions, altered affordances, and political struggles within a state cloud computing implementation reduced levels of service among records management professionals, in spite of their strongly expressed desire to manage records with excellence. Struggles to maintain ownership and control over organizational processes and resources illustrate the power dynamics that are affected by the design of a new system implementation. By designing the system with a single goal in mind (centralization to reduce costs), strategic management failed to consider otherwise predictable outcomes of reducing the resources controlled by a group with lesser power and increasing the resources controlled by an already dominant power within the institution. These findings provide valuable insights into the considerations which cloud computing designs should take into account. They also offer an understanding of changing educational requirements for records management workers to engage more effectively across occupations in technologically changing environments and the potential risks that cloud computing provide to productivity.

To investigate the impact of AR interfaces on human cognition, we developed a mobile AR app and conducted an experiment. Subjects tested the app, equipped with AR capabilities, alongside traditional two-dimensional (2D) representations for various product types.

However, in practice, the introduction of AI tools often fails to meet these expectations and results in negative consequences, such as worker resistance and dissatisfaction. Yet we have little understanding of the process of how and why initially positive design intentions of AI tools result in negative consequences. Building on a qualitative in-depth case study of a Chinese firm introducing an AI tool in sales, we found that whereas the AI tool's initial design seemingly intended to lead to salespeople's empowerment and first achieved respective outcomes, over time the tool was appropriated for managerial control. We show that this devolution emerged organically from a growing managerial awareness of the affordances that the AI tool offered managers to perform their work better. Our study contributes to the literature on AI by highlighting the potential dangers of AI tools and emphasizing the importance of including workers in the AI tool's design and implementation phases. • We highlight the process of how initially positive design intentions of AI tools result in negative consequences. • Managers' behaviors, beliefs and goals are crucial in shaping AI outcomes and can trigger the devolution of AI tools' positive implementation to their negative consequences. • To prevent the misuse of AI tools through managers, it is essential to involve both managers and workers in the design and implementation process.",20240301,"Monod, Emmanuel ; Mayer, Anne-Sophie ; Straub, Detmar ; Joyce, Elisabeth ; Qi, Jiayin",Article,Academic Journal,Mar2024,true,Information & Organization,Artificial intelligence ; Self-efficacy,JOUR,,,1471-7727,,,,,eng,Elsevier B.V.,N.PAG,N.PAG,,34,1,10.1016/j.infoandorg.2023.100498,,JG1,,https://research.ebsco.com/linkprocessor/plink?id=17083689-79e3-38af-b417-739fa8358fd5

One outlet that could potentially address barriers librarians face when accessing PD is social media, which can help librarians communicate across distances, are used at low to no cost, and can be accessed asynchronously as needed. Drawing from 25 studies conducted in 21 countries, this systematic literature review explored the empirical themes evident in the current research on librarians' adoption of social media for PD purposes. This review found (1) there is considerable potential in adopting social media for PD across contexts; (2) studies focused on the affordances provided by social media in areas where there is limited infrastructure, support, and resources for PD; (3) in congruence with prior research pertaining to the Technology Acceptance Model, librarians who felt more tech-savvy were more likely to adopt social media for PD; and (4) social media was viewed as democratic in creating a platform where diverse voices could participate.

Accordingly, one of the most new presence concepts in this field is “gamifying the library services”. Gamification has been defined as a process of enhancing services with motivational affordances in order to invoke gameful experiences and behavioral outcomes. So, this research aims to design the librarygame website and investigate the effect of its implementation on self-determination dimensions among the users of central library of Bushehr University of Medical Sciences. This is an applied study which has been done by a “pretest-posttest design” approach. The population included all medical library and information science students of Bushehr University of Medical Sciences (N=45). First, the librarygame website named “Ketabdan” designed based on gathered data by systematic review. Then, the pretest-posttest design was applied to study the effect of Ketabdan software on the participants using “Player (User) Experience of Need Satisfaction Scale” questionnaire. SPSS 22.0 was used to analyze data. The results showed that the original library website had a low adaptability level with self-determination dimensions of the users; conversely, the librarygame website had been shown a high adaptability level with self-determination dimensions of the users. Also, the rate of the effectiveness of Ketabdan software on four dimensions of self-determination was high, while the original library website was low. According to the importance and necessity of gamifying academic library websites, library managers should design websites based on game dynamics, mechanics, and elements as well as basic psychological needs of users.

"Library, Information Science & Technology Abstracts",lxh,125017522,Making sense of comments on YouTube educational videos: a self-directed learning perspective.,"Purpose -- Through the lens of self-directed theory, the purpose of this paper is to investigate if social technologies such as YouTube will be viable to disseminate educational instructions and in the process empowering learners to take charge of their learning. Design/methodology/approach -- A total of 150 educational videos on YouTube were selected and 29,386 comments extracted using the authors' customized extraction software application. Sentiment and qualitative content analyses were performed. Findings -- Results indicate that YouTube can play important roles in facilitating online self-directed learning (SDL) as the findings uncovered a variety of learning and social affordances of YouTube. However, caution should be exercised as high views and well-commented videos might not imply quality and credibility. This study concludes that YouTube generally provides a conducive a learning environment that affords learners the resources to meet their SDL objectives. Research limitations/implications -- To the best of knowledge, this is the first study that investigates SDL in social media by combining both qualitative content and sentiment analyses. The study shows that such a hybrid approach of combining two diverse analytical techniques provides an innovative means to make sense of comments expressed in social media. Practical implications -- The results will help educational institutions and policy-makers to craft better programs for public education and create policies to help self-directed learners in evaluating online video resources. Originality/value -- Despite a wealth of literature on the use of technologies to support learning, the majority of work done to date has dealt in the classroom context. Studies on SDL using educational content on YouTube are limited. Hence, this research contributes by providing insights on how educational institutions can move toward the direction of building collaborative digital learning platforms with relevant educational instruction and resources to enable users to participate in lifelong self-learning and education.",20170801,"Lee, Chei Sian ; Osop, Hamzah ; Goh, Dion Hoe-Lian ; Kelni, Gani",Article,Academic Journal,2017,true,Online Information Review,Educational films ; Application software ; Content analysis ; Self-managed learning (Personnel management) ; YouTube (Web resource),JOUR,,,1468-4527,,,,,eng,Emerald Publishing Limited,625,611,15,41,5,10.1108/OIR-09-2016-0274,,9NA,,https://research.ebsco.com/linkprocessor/plink?id=5369a458-0253-3fb4-9134-73a514246ee2

This study investigated the affordances of mobile technologies to support mathematics instruction by teachers. An exploratory study employing questionnaires and semi-structured interviews revealed that, while mathematics instruction can be augmented with mobile learning, the majority of schools in Indonesia have banned student use of mobile phones in classrooms. Teachers are concerned about the improper use of mobile phones that could impact their students' mental well-being and distract them from learning. Most teachers perceive mobile technologies to be disruptive and seem reluctant to use them for teaching delivery. However, teachers are eager to experiment with digital technologies within mathematics instruction. Our findings suggest infusing alternate technologies that fit better with the school's teaching and learning environment. This includes web-based applications that can run on different digital devices ranging from desktop computers, laptops, and tablets, to mobile phones.

One goal of such support is to target, help, and educate “risky” groups of parents, such as young parents. It is striking, however, that young parents have a conspicuously low degree of participation in this type of parenting support. Drawing on the assumption that many young parents go online to seek, give, and receive peer parenting support, this paper presents a case study of activities within three Facebook groups. Using a combination of social network analysis, online ethnography, and interviews, we analyze how social network relationships and discussions differ depending on whether the analyzed Facebook group in question is administrated by professionals or peers, what the role of professional experts is, and how young parents might use social media to take control of their own support needs. Our results indicate that some of the affordances provided by Facebook might contribute to a challenging of the roles of “skilled” professionals versus “risky” young parents.",20170701,"Sjöberg, Magdalena ; Lindgren, Simon",Article,Academic Journal,Jul-Sep2017,true,Journal of Technology in Human Services,Social media ; Sweden ; Interviewing ; Mothers ; Ethnology research ; Social support,JOUR,,,1522-8835,,,,,eng,Taylor & Francis Ltd,270,247,24,35,3,10.1080/15228835.2017.1367350,,8AO,,https://research.ebsco.com/linkprocessor/plink?id=3cc673e4-03e8-3cb7-a058-6d5e2ad3e7d4

This study aimed to bridge the gap by exploring i) the relationship between task complexity and difficulty; ii) factors affecting task difficulty; and iii) the relationship between task difficulty, task complexity, and user search behaviors in MIR. An empirical user experiment was conducted with 51 participants and a novel MIR system. The participants searched for 6 topics across 3 complexity levels. The results revealed that i) perceived task difficulty in music search is influenced by task complexity, user background, system affordances, and task uncertainty and enjoyability; and ii) perceived task difficulty in MIR is significantly correlated with effectiveness metrics such as the number of songs found, number of clicks, and task completion time.

"Library, Information Science & Technology Abstracts",lxh,130769754,Digital Technologies and Sustainable Livestock Systems in Rural Communities.,"Abstract: The 43<sup>rd</sup> Committee on World Food Security (CFS) convention reiterated the importance of livestock towards eliminating food insecurity across the globe. Livestock provides extensive services and products which are critical in addressing the issues of hunger, malnutrition, health and diseases. However, despite such importance, livestock systems across the globe continue to face the challenge of sustainability. In this research article, using ethnographic research techniques, we examine the Beitbridge livestock systems to understand the vulnerabilities within the system and current efforts to overcome. The article identifies that the Beitbridge livestock system, similar to many others, faces numerous socio‐ecological and political economy challenges. Also, in the past engagement of the author and the community, it emerged that there was limited use of digital technologies within the community. Therefore, this study explore whether digital technologies can contribute towards sustainability of livestock and if so, how. The major findings of the study are that, DTs have affordances which can be exploited to contribute towards the sustainability of the livestock system. However, in order for this to happen, there is need for convergence of conditions e.g. presence of supporting institutions and improvement of digital infrastructure. These findings confirm the need for context based studies on DTs. The findings of the study provide practitioners and policy makers ‘something to think about’ in the development of DTs and supporting systems.",20170701,"Gwaka, Leon Tinashe",Article,Academic Journal,Jul2017,true,Electronic Journal of Information Systems in Developing Countries,,JOUR,,,1681-4835,,,,,eng,Wiley-Blackwell,24,1,24,81,1,10.1002/j.1681-4835.2017.tb00598.x,,1D48,,https://research.ebsco.com/linkprocessor/plink?id=f24c4716-8826-34fa-a767-92ce2e3470f6

Such powerful tools have brought us to reconsider our concept of privacy and social involvement in order to make them fit into this wider environment. It is possible to claim that the information and communication technologies (ICT) revolution is changing our world and is having a core role as a mediating factor for social movements (e.g., Arab spring) and political decisions (e.g., Brexit), shaping the world in a faster and shared brand new way. It is then interesting to explore how the perception of this brand new environment (in terms of social engagement, privacy perception and sense of belonging to a community) differs even in similar cultures separated by recent historical reasons. Recent historical events may in effect have shaped a different psychological representation of Participation, Privacy and Sense of Community in ICT environments, determining a different perception of affordances and concerns of these complex behaviors. The aim of this research is to examine the relation between the constructs of Sense of Community, Participation and Privacy compared with culture and gender, considering the changes that have occurred in the last few years with the introduction of the web environment. A questionnaire, including ad hoc created scales for Participation and Privacy, have been administered to 180 participants from Turkey and Italy.

"Library, Information Science & Technology Abstracts",lxh,121839390,"Platformed racism: the mediation and circulation of an Australian race-based controversy on Twitter, Facebook and YouTube.","This article proposes the concept ‘platformed racism’ as a new form of racism derived from the culture of social media platforms ‒ their design, technical affordances, business models and policies ‒ and the specific cultures of use associated with them. Platformed racism has dual meanings: first, it evokes platforms as amplifiers and manufacturers of racist discourse and second, it describes the modes of platform governance that reproduce (but that can also address) social inequalities. The national and medium specificity of platformed racism requires nuanced investigation. As a first step, I examined platformed racism through a particular national race-based controversy, the booing of the Australian Football League Indigenous star Adam Goodes, as it was mediated by Twitter, Facebook and YouTube. Second, by using an issue mapping approach to social media analysis, I followed the different actors, themes and objects involved in this controversy to account for the medium specificity of platforms. Platformed racism unfolded in the Adam Goodes controversy as the entanglement between users’ practices to disguise and amplify racist humour and abuse, and the contribution of platforms’ features and algorithms in the circulation of overt and covert hate speech. In addition, the distributed nature of platforms’ editorial practices ‒ which involve their technical infrastructure, policies, moderators and users’ curation of content ‒ obscured the scope and type of this abuse. The paper shows that the concept of platformed racism challenges the discourse of neutrality that characterises social media platforms’ self-representations, and opens new theoretical terrain to engage with their material politics.",20170601,"Matamoros-Fernández, Ariadna",Article,Academic Journal,Jun2017,true,"Information, Communication & Society",Social media ; Algorithms ; Racism ; Technology ; Business models,JOUR,,,1369-118X,,,,,eng,Taylor & Francis Ltd,946,930,17,20,6,10.1080/1369118X.2017.1293130,,5BA,,https://research.ebsco.com/linkprocessor/plink?id=e38d858f-9cd9-360b-bd92-cc10d2037df6

"Library, Information Science & Technology Abstracts",lxh,123908413,Social Media Analytics: Implications for Journalism and Democracy.,"Social media are transforming the information-media landscape and the practices of newsrooms. They are measured by social media analytics, in terms of who is using social media content, where they are, what they are doing with it and how the content is circulating in networks. Social media analytics provide media organizations and others with a new and greater knowledge of their audience. This paper reports the uses by one media organization, the BBC World Service, of one company's social media analytics packages. While representing users' behavior, analytics agglomerate this roughly, and they do so using techniques, or algorithms, that are opaque, and that sum data with different and in some cases unknown qualities. The users of these packages can have only a limited understanding of the validity, reliability or meaning of vast quantities of data that is presented as self-evidential and obviously useful. At the same time, social media analytics provide affordances to transform social and media relations, in that they empower users in relation to producers in media organizations. Far from neutral instruments, social media analytics represent the organizational structure and context in which they are used. The paper discusses the implications of these packages for journalism and for democracy, and concludes with discussion of some key ethical implications of social media data and analytics packages that arise from the power relations that are implicated in social media analytics.",20170501,"Mackay, Hugh",Article,Academic Journal,Spring2017,true,Journal of Information Ethics,Social media ; Content analysis ; Mass media ; Organizational structure ; Journalism ; Democracy,JOUR,,,1061-9321,,,,,eng,"McFarland & Company, Inc.",48,34,15,26,1,,,GMM,,https://research.ebsco.com/linkprocessor/plink?id=a56de457-0b72-3c51-87d9-d46c7900d62c

The aim of this research is to examine the role of the need for cognition in the reading behaviour of university students. Need for cognition is a personality trait characterized by one's motivation to engage in effortful thinking. It is an important intervening variable in the process of seeking information, and specifically in the domain of reading. Method. The research method included a survey of reading behaviours and attitudes, and the shortened need for cognition scale. The sample consists of 274 undergraduate university students of social sciences. Analysis. Psychometric properties of a shortened scale of the need for cognition were examined with principal factor analysis. The role it has in reading behaviour was explored with correlations. Results. The shortened need for cognition scale has good properties, with acceptable reliability. It is positively correlated with reading books for study and popular science books. These topics require high engagement in the complex cognitive activities. Usage of smartphones and tablets is not related to the need for cognition, and the usage of e-ink e-readers is. This correlation indicates that e-ink e-readers are suitable for engaging in complex cognitive activities. Conclusion. The need for cognition has an important role as an intrinsic motivation for engagement in reading complex content, especially when reading popular science books and books for study.

"Library, Information Science & Technology Abstracts",lxh,121313671,Beyond the Bedtime Story: In Search of Epistemic Possibilities and the Innovative Potential of Disquieting Picturebooks.,"In this article I consider the innovative potential of disquieting picturebooks to catalyze critical inquiry and as an alternative to more quieting texts and practices that orient toward knowledge as a thing known. I examine five disquieting international picturebooks that take up sites of struggle in different locations and posit that each offers a different epistemic invitation to readers. The five different invitations I describe are: embracing ambiguity; opening to hurt; pausing for interruption; witnessing resistance; and hearing silences. I view this not as an exhaustive typology but rather as an exploration of the range of the kinds of disquieting that are important to critical inquiry. As some of the first texts children encounter, picturebooks make marks on experience that extend into tacit theories about reading and knowledge. I argue that disquieting picturebooks can be viewed as a form of innovation that offers varied and particular epistemic possibilities for the children and communities that read them. The picturebook, with its defining verbal and visual synergy, has particular affordances for conveying the complex simultaneity of struggle and hopefulness and for serving as a platform for social sharing and collective engagement.",20170101,"Whitelaw, Jessica",Article,Academic Journal,2017,true,Bookbird: A Journal of International Children's Literature (Johns Hopkins University Press),Bedtime ; Epistemics ; Psychological typologies ; Ambiguity ; Communities,JOUR,,,0006-7377,,,,,eng,Johns Hopkins University Press,41,33,9,55,1,10.1353/bkb.2017.0004,,8X08,,https://research.ebsco.com/linkprocessor/plink?id=8deaed6d-1bfe-3612-b28c-7651d957351a
"Library, Information Science & Technology Abstracts",lxh,122949286,Digitalization as institutional work: a case of designing a tool for changing diabetes care.,"Purpose E-health tools for patients aim to change current care practices. However the role of IT in transforming health care is not straightforward. The purpose of this paper is to understand how this change process unfolds and what characterizes the process by which visions of new care practices become inscribed into digital tools.Design/methodology/approach The study adopted a qualitative research design and it is based on an interpretive case study on the digitalization of a tool for diabetes care used in a hospital in Norway. Data have been collected via interviews and observations. Digitalization activities are understood as institutional work in order to examine the relation between the decisions taken in the design process and the intended change of the practices of diabetes care.Findings The study identifies three types of activities of institutional work: inscription of self-reflection, inscription of legitimation and inscription of new usage. The analysis of these activities shows how the vision of patients’ more active, learning and reflection-oriented role is inscribed into digital technology; how institutional work strives both for change and for legitimation thus smoothing the transition to a new institutional arrangement; and how institutional work relates to digital materiality.Originality/value The study contributes to the institutional theory literature by conceptualizing digitalization as institutional work toward changing institutions. It also contributes to the IS literature on digitalization by providing an analysis of how the affordances of digital materials support the work toward new institutions.",20170101,"Thorseng, Anne Asmyr ; Grisot, Miria",Article,Academic Journal,2017,true,Information Technology & People,Electronic health records ; Digital technology ; Qualitative research ; Norway ; Treatment of diabetes ; Hospitals,JOUR,,,0959-3845,,,,,eng,Emerald Publishing Limited,243,227,17,30,1,10.1108/ITP-07-2015-0155,,67S,,https://research.ebsco.com/linkprocessor/plink?id=a1e263bf-8034-3932-bc2c-eda430ce5e85

A case study of rare disease patient organisations.,"This exploratory work investigates the role of digital media in expanding health discourse practices in a way to transform traditional structures of agency in public health. By focusing on a sample of rare disease patient organisations as representative of contemporary health activism, this study investigates the role of digital communication in the development of (1) bottom-up sharing and co-production of health knowledge, (2) health public engagement dynamics and (3) health information pathways. Findings show that digital media affordances for patient organisations go beyond the provision of social support for patient communities; they ease one-way, two-way and crowdsourced processes of health knowledge sharing, exchange and co-production, provide personalised routes to health public engagement and bolster the emergence of varied pathways to health information where experiential knowledge and medical authority are equally valued.

The MIT Press, Cambridge, ). Historically, authors, publishers and editors have preferred to check and mark up hard-copy page proofs because it has been easy and flexible to read, cross-reference and annotate.

This article compares the affordances of paper in regard to editorial mark-up with those of digital, and demonstrates how digital affordances have impacted positively on editors' workflow within educational publishing's highly pressured production process.

Scripts can be understood as flexible, individual memory structures guiding our understanding and actions, but also as instructional interventions that help students use the affordances offered in new learning spaces. In study 1 (N= 82), the authors observed that when thrown into an unfamiliar, new learning space, students showed low individual learning and low satisfaction with the learning space, compared with students who received basic hints concerning how to use the affordances of the learning space. Study 2 (N= 77) demonstrated positive effects of an external script to guide collaborative decision-making in the new learning space, compared to unstructured collaboration. Thus, a script perspective helps to understand why it is so difficult to use new learning spaces effectively.

"Library, Information Science & Technology Abstracts",lxh,75355754,A comparative survey of Personalised Information Retrieval and Adaptive Hypermedia techniques,"A key driver for next generation web information retrieval systems is becoming the degree to which a user’s search and presentation experience is adapted to individual user properties and contexts of use. Over the past decades, two parallel threads of personalisation research have emerged, one originating in the document space in the area of Personalised Information Retrieval (PIR) and the other arising from the hypertext space in the field of Adaptive Hypermedia (AH). PIR typically aims to bias search results towards more personally relevant information by modifying traditional document ranking algorithms. Such techniques tend to represent users with simplified personas (often based on historic interests), enabling the efficient calculation of personalised ranked lists. On the other hand, the field of Adaptive Hypermedia (AH) has addressed the challenge of biasing content retrieval and presentation by adapting towards multiple characteristics. These characteristics, more typically called personalisation “dimensions”, include user goals or prior knowledge, enabling adaptive and personalised result compositions and navigations. The question arises as to whether it is possible to provide a comparison of PIR and AH, where the respective strengths and limitations can be exposed, but also where potential complementary affordances can be identified. This survey investigates the key techniques and impacts in the use of PIR and AH technology in order to identify such affordances and limitations. In particular, the techniques are analysed by examining key activities in the retrieval process, namely (i) query adaptation, (ii) adaptive retrieval and (iii) adaptive result composition and presentation. In each of these areas, the survey identifies individual strengths and limitations. Following this comparison of techniques, the paper also illustrates an example of a potential synergy in a hybridised approach, where adaptation can be tailored in different aspects of PIR and AH systems. Moreover, the concerns resulting from interdependencies and the respective tradeoffs of techniques are discussed, along with potential future directions and remaining challenges.",20120701,"Steichen, Ben ; Ashman, Helen ; Wade, Vincent",Article,Academic Journal,Jul2012,true,Information Processing & Management,Information retrieval research ; Information storage & retrieval systems ; Information resources management ; Relevance ranking (Information science) ; Surveys ; Information processing ; Hypermedia,JOUR,,,0306-4573,,,,,eng,Elsevier B.V.,724,698,27,48,4,10.1016/j.ipm.2011.12.004,,INM,,https://research.ebsco.com/linkprocessor/plink?id=efc674d2-e300-3dbf-b305-84bbd14f7149

In this qualitative study, 12 award-winning online instructors were interviewed for their online teaching practices focused on blending, design, facilitation, and assessment of asynchronous and synchronous online modalities. Data was collected through virtual interviews which were recorded, transcribed and analyzed. Award-winning instructor practices of blending are discussed through their blending decisions, sequences, and models. Instructors shared their decisions related to blending, such as modality purposes, affordances, and required or optional synchronous sessions. Blending sequences that emerged were asynchronous followed by synchronous, asynchronous followed by synchronous and then asynchronous again. Blending models that resulted were the complement model, replacement model and enhancement model. Asynchronous and synchronous design, facilitation and assessment strategies used by the award-winning online instructors are discussed in detail. The findings have implications for online instructors, students, instructional designers and administrators. • 12 award-winning online instructors were interviewed. • Blending decisions, sequences, and models were identified. • Blending purposes, affordances, and synchronous session types were discussed. • Blending models were complement, replacement and enhancement models. • Bichronous design, facilitation and assessment strategies were identified.",20230101,"Martin, Florence ; Kumar, Swapna ; Ritzhaupt, Albert D. ; Polly, Drew",Article,Academic Journal,Jan2023,true,Internet & Higher Education,Online education ; Virtual communities ; Synchronous electric motors,JOUR,,,1096-7516,,,,,eng,Elsevier B.V.,N.PAG,N.PAG,,56,,10.1016/j.iheduc.2022.100879,,5CO,,https://research.ebsco.com/linkprocessor/plink?id=3574a241-35a0-3087-86bd-68d614ecad47
"Library, Information Science & Technology Abstracts",lxh,173855014,The construction of self-sovereign identity: Extending the interpretive flexibility of technology towards institutions.,"Ever-growing concerns over 'Big Brother' continue driving individuals towards user-centric identity management systems. Nascent innovations are framed as offering Self-Sovereign Identity (SSI). Because of the association with value-laden ideals and technical components like blockchain, SSI is caught up with both hype and idiosyncrasy. Competing interpretations of SSI damage the public discourse and risk misrepresenting affordances these systems might offer. Based on a qualitative inductive interview study and document analysis, this article extrapolates a constructivist theoretical frame – the Extended Model of Interpretive Flexibility – which combines insights from the Social Construction of Technology and the Structurational Model of Technology. The Extended Model of Interpretive Flexibility highlights malleability in the technical implementations and social representations, which in turn is affected by and influences institutional properties around SSI. This research further offers implications for practice around the implementation of SSI, in particular regarding policy, management, and design. For theory on public sector information systems, the proposed model has generalizable potential for the analysis of socio-technical systems and offers future research directions. • Self-sovereign identity (SSI) is subject to ambiguity and varying technical implementations. • The role of institutional properties in IT artifacts' ambiguity is unclear. • We conducted an inductive study with expert interviews and SSI project documentation. • Our Extended Model of Interpretive Flexibility accounts for the role of institutions. • We offer a holistic view on SSI with policy, management, and design implications.",20231001,"Weigl, Linda ; Barbereau, Tom ; Fridgen, Gilbert",Article,Academic Journal,Oct2023,true,Government Information Quarterly,Information storage & retrieval systems ; Identity management systems ; Sociotechnical systems ; Collective representation ; Public sector,JOUR,,,0740-624X,,,,,eng,Elsevier B.V.,N.PAG,N.PAG,,40,4,10.1016/j.giq.2023.101873,,GIQ,,https://research.ebsco.com/linkprocessor/plink?id=16fe39b9-a67b-3f8d-bea7-45c0c74387c0

In this article we focus on a specific type: information capacity and its effects on implementation and policy outcomes. Through a comparative case study of the COVID-19 vaccination programs in the United States, Mexico, and the Netherlands, we study how a government's information capacity – the capacity to collect and process information regarding citizens, businesses, and territory – structures administrative burdens for citizens. We develop a typology of models of information capacity (infrastructural, system-by-system, and ad hoc) and explain how they influence policy implementation. We show how the infrastructural model is best equipped to absorb administrative burdens for a majority of citizens, while the system-by-system model and especially the ad hoc model tend to push costs towards frontline workers and citizens. Yet, even if information capacities may shape the affordances of policy implementation beyond the direct control of politicians and policymakers, governments still can make the deliberate choice to mitigate their negative effects by organizing operational flexibility and discretion. • A government's information capacity structures policy implementation. • We identify infrastructural, system-by-system, and ad hoc information capacities. • Infrastructural models are likely best equipped to absorb administrative burdens. • However, each model has exclusionary mechanisms for certain target groups. • Operational flexibility and discretion should be organized to mitigate them.",20231001,"Peeters, Rik ; Rentería, César ; Cejudo, Guillermo M.",Article,Academic Journal,Oct2023,true,Government Information Quarterly,Government information ; COVID-19 pandemic ; Mexico ; Netherlands ; COVID-19 vaccines ; Process capability ; Anti-vaccination movement ; Discretion,JOUR,,,0740-624X,,,,,eng,Elsevier B.V.,N.PAG,N.PAG,,40,4,10.1016/j.giq.2023.101871,,GIQ,,https://research.ebsco.com/linkprocessor/plink?id=c69ecec8-ce5b-3098-8141-23793001ceee
"Library, Information Science & Technology Abstracts",lxh,170380362,Dynamics of digitally networked leadership in #blacklivesmatter.,"Using the hashtag #blacklivesmatter, activists have given new impetus to aspirations of 'leaderful' organizing. Disavowing the centralization of leadership and rethinking the history of the struggle for civil rights, many have sought to develop and revamp models of decentralized leadership. Digital networking features prominently in these models, but the literature suggests its role is ambiguous: while social media provide affordances for decentralized leadership, they may also induce the centralization of leadership. To examine such leadership dynamics, we adopt a computational approach. Drawing on a dataset of roughly 18 million tweets collected over a 30-month period, we examine two aspects of leadership dynamics: the concentration of leadership (i.e., inequality in terms of centrality within networks) and the consolidation of leadership (i.e., the degree to which central figures retain prominence over time). Engaging with the measurement of network inequality by differentiating temporal aspects of concentration and consolidation, we show that leadership dynamics fluctuate strongly over time. Aside from a select few individuals, there is little consolidation of leadership: new voices can consistently rise to prominence. Beyond providing an examination of online leadership dynamics within the Movement for Black Lives, this paper shows how computational analyses can be adopted in ways that do justice to the dynamic and diverse nature of movements.",20230801,"van Haperen, Sander ; Uitermark, Justus",Article,Academic Journal,Aug2023,true,First Monday,Social media ; Black Lives Matter movement ; Motion ; Leadership,JOUR,,,1396-0466,,,,,eng,First Monday,1,1,1,28,8,10.5210/fm.v28i8.12936,,DZZ,,https://research.ebsco.com/linkprocessor/plink?id=4cbb14f3-6885-38bd-8731-17dc63d02c5e

With the onset of COVID-19, the need for social distancing and minimal physical contact challenged and interrupted hospital practices. In response, remote audio-visual functionality of digital technologies were appropriated in different ways, as stakeholders – state actors, managers, health professionals, and family members – sought to improvise and enhance the protection of persons concerned. We show how emerging practices were guided by the dominant institutional logics of stakeholders responding to the crisis.

See correction statement in: https://publichealth.jmir.org/2021/2/e28131/ Background: Public health organizations have begun to use social media to increase awareness of health harm and positively improve health behavior. Little is known about effective strategies to disseminate health education messages digitally and ultimately achieve optimal audience engagement. Objective: This study aims to assess the difference in audience engagement with identical antismoking health messages on three social media sites (Twitter, Facebook, and Instagram) and with a referring link to a tobacco prevention website cited in these messages. We hypothesized that health messages might not receive the same user engagement on these media, although these messages were identical and distributed at the same time. Methods: We measured the effect of health promotion messages on the risk of smoking among users of three social media sites (Twitter, Facebook, and Instagram) and disseminated 1275 health messages between April 19 and July 12, 2017 (85 days). The identical messages were distributed at the same time and as organic (unpaid) and advertised (paid) messages, each including a link to an educational website with more information about the topic. Outcome measures included message engagement (ie, the click-through rate [CTR] of the social media messages) and educational website engagement (ie, the CTR on the educational website [wCTR]). To analyze the data and model relationships, we used mixed effects negative binomial regression, z-statistic, and the Hosmer-Lemeshow goodness-of-fit test. Results: Comparisons between social media sites showed that CTRs for identical antitobacco health messages differed significantly across social media (P <.001 for all). Instagram showed the statistically significant highest overall mean message engagement (CTR=0.0037; 95% CI 0.0032-0.0042), followed by Facebook (CTR=0.0026; 95% CI 0.0022-0.0030) and Twitter (CTR=0.0015; 95% CI 0.0013-0.0017). Facebook showed the highest as well as the lowest CTR for any individual message. However, the message CTR is not indicative of user engagement with the educational website content. Pairwise comparisons of the social media sites differed with respect to the wCTR (P <.001 for all). Messages on Twitter showed the lowest CTR, but they resulted in the highest level of website engagement (wCTR=0.6308; 95% CI 0.5640-0.6975), followed by Facebook (wCTR=0.2213; 95% CI 0.1932-0.2495) and Instagram (wCTR=0.0334; 95% CI 0.0230-0.0438). We found a statistically significant higher CTR for organic (unpaid) messages (CTR=0.0074; 95% CI 0.0047-0.0100) compared with paid advertisements (CTR=0.0022; 95% CI 0.0017-0.0027; P <.001 and P <.001, respectively). Conclusions: Our study provides evidence-based insights to guide the design of health promotion efforts on social media. Future studies should examine the platform-specific impact of psycholinguistic message variations on user engagement, include newer sites such as Snapchat and TikTok, and study the correlation between web-based behavior and real-world health behavior change. The need is urgent in light of increased health-related marketing and misinformation on social media.

We propose a framework for examining pedagogical practices based on an analysis of the nature of pedagogy as revealed in the literature. In the light of this framework we discuss empirical evidence of the use of different types of ICT in different subjects and phases of education. We identify pedagogical issues associated with ICT use and their implications for teachers' pedagogical reasoning and practices. The evidence suggests that new affordances provided by ICT-based learning environments require teachers to undertake more complex pedagogical reasoning than before in their planning and teaching that incorporates knowledge of specific affordances and how these relate to their subject-based teaching objectives as well as the knowledge they have always needed to plan for their students' learning. In addition the research shows that teachers' beliefs about the value of ICT for learning and the nature of successful learning environments are important in teachers' pedagogical reasoning.,20041001,"Webb, Mary ; Cox, Margaret",Article,Academic Journal,Oct2004,true,"Technology, Pedagogy & Education",Information & communication technologies ; Educational technology ; Learning ; Secondary education ; Teachers ; Primary education,JOUR,,,1475-939X,,,,,eng,Taylor & Francis Ltd,286,235,52,13,3,10.1080/14759390400200183,,131K,,https://research.ebsco.com/linkprocessor/plink?id=e4c302ba-c1ae-3427-aff8-971a18ba6041
"Library, Information Science & Technology Abstracts",lxh,117734693,The experience of teaching online and its impact on faculty innovation across delivery methods.,"As traditional colleges and universities increasingly incorporate online learning programs into their curriculum, it is important to understand the benefits that may accrue to the faculty who teach in those programs, particularly those that influence instructors' continuing participation in face-to-face (f2f) teaching. The purpose of this qualitative study was to provide a greater understanding of how the experience of teaching online influenced instructors' thinking, planning, and enactment in their teaching practice across delivery methods. Four overarching themes emerged: 1) Reflecting on Practice , 2) Creating Structure , 3) Conducting the Class , and 4) Facilitating Learning . Reflecting on Practice occurred when instructors questioned themselves about their teaching goals and objectives. Creating Structure encompasses course planning and designing. Conducting the Class refers to the ongoing consideration of maximizing class time for student learning. Facilitating Learning involved creating conditions that promote student learning. Three trends had an impact on the themes: 1) a shift in focus from teaching to learning, 2) a growing awareness of the affordances of technology and media, and 3) a weakening of the boundary between in-class and out-of-class learning activities.",20161001,"Kearns, Lorna R.",Article,Academic Journal,Oct2016,true,Internet & Higher Education,Distance education ; University faculty ; Educational innovations ; College curriculum ; Educational programs ; Project method in teaching,JOUR,,,1096-7516,,,,,eng,Elsevier B.V.,78,71,8,31,,10.1016/j.iheduc.2016.06.005,,5CO,,https://research.ebsco.com/linkprocessor/plink?id=9ec80d87-7e2b-383b-ba92-720495159354

This article presents a diary study of 54 master’s students conducting group projects across four semesters. A total of 332 diary entries were analysed using the C5 model of collaboration that incorporates elements of communication, contribution, coordination, cooperation and collaboration. Quantitative and qualitative analyses show how these elements relate to one another for students working on collaborative projects. It was found that face-to-face communication related positively with satisfaction and group dynamics, whereas online chat correlated positively with feedback and closing the gap. Managing scope was perceived to be the most common challenge. The findings suggest the varying affordances and drawbacks of different methods of communication, collaborative work styles and the strategies of group members.",20161001,"Shah, Chirag ; Leeder, Chris",Article,Academic Journal,Oct2016,true,Journal of Information Science,Education ; Collaborative learning ; Graduate students ; Group work in education ; Communication in education ; Mathematical models,JOUR,,,0165-5515,,,,,eng,"Sage Publications, Ltd.",629,609,21,42,5,10.1177/0165551515603322,,INJ,,https://research.ebsco.com/linkprocessor/plink?id=7613c652-5957-34ff-99a7-e7c6b605bfea

Drawing upon self-determination theory, we investigate 2 forms of motivation: internally driven (autonomous motivation) and externally driven (controlled motivation). Knowledge sharing could be viewed as a required in-role activity or as discretionary extra-role behavior. In this study, we examine the moderating effect of role perceptions on the relations between each of the two motivational constructs and knowledge sharing, paying particular attention to the affordances of the enabling information technology. An analysis of survey data from a wiki-based organizational encyclopedia in a large, multinational firm reveals that when contributors' motivation is externally driven, they are more likely to share knowledge if this activity is viewed as in-role behavior. However, when contributors' motivation is internally driven, they are more likely to participate in knowledge sharing when this activity is viewed as extra-role behavior.

This study examined the use of a videoconference discussion in an instructional methodology course as a means to enrich the process of reflection and encourage critical reflection. Critical action research methodology was used by the researchers to evaluate the addition of videoconferencing to a model of scaffolded reflection which was already part of the course. The findings suggest that the introduction of a videoconference discussion to the scaffolded reflection model enriched critical reflection on four topics: technology use, multicultural curriculum and instruction, censorship of web-based resources, and accountability and assessment. The discussion of these topics allowed the preservice teachers to think about their own agency, and the affordances and constraints of their school context.

Fueled by technological possibilities and an increasing demand to demonstrate impact beyond the scientific community, altmetrics have received great attention as potential democratizers of the scientific reward system and indicators of societal impact. This paper focuses on the current challenges for altmetrics. Heterogeneity, data quality and particular dependencies are identified as the three major issues and discussed in detail with an emphasis on past developments in bibliometrics. The heterogeneity of altmetrics reflects the diversity of the acts and online events, most of which take place on social media platforms. This heterogeneity has made it difficult to establish a common definition or conceptual framework. Data quality issues become apparent in the lack of accuracy, consistency and replicability of various altmetrics, which is largely affected by the dynamic nature of social media events. Furthermore altmetrics are shaped by technical possibilities and are particularly dependent on the availability of APIs and DOIs, strongly dependent on data providers and aggregators, and potentially influenced by the technical affordances of underlying platforms.",20160701,"Haustein, Stefanie",Article,Academic Journal,Jul2016,true,Scientometrics,Altmetrics ; Data quality ; Social media ; Bibliometrics ; Big data ; Internetworking ; Data integration ; Research management,JOUR,,,0138-9130,,,,,eng,Springer Nature,423,413,11,108,1,10.1007/s11192-016-1910-9,,NMM,,https://research.ebsco.com/linkprocessor/plink?id=8fa94b2b-d668-3484-bee5-4cd31ccd839e

"Library, Information Science & Technology Abstracts",lxh,114604940,On online collaboration and construction of shared knowledge: Assessing mediation capability in computer supported argument visualization tools.,"Collaborative Computer- Supported Argument Visualization ( CCSAV) has often been proposed as an alternative over more conventional, mainstream platforms for online discussion (e.g., online forums and wikis). CCSAV tools require users to contribute to the creation of a joint artifact (argument map) instead of contributing to a conversation. In this paper we assess empirically the effects of this fundamental design choice and show that the absence of conversational affordances and socially salient information in representation-centric tools is detrimental to the users' collaboration experience. We report empirical findings from a study in which subjects using different collaborative platforms (a forum, an argumentation platform, and a socially augmented argumentation tool) were asked to discuss and predict the price of a commodity. By comparing users' experience across several metrics we found evidence that the collaborative performance decreases gradually when we remove conversational interaction and other types of socially salient information. We interpret these findings through theories developed in conversational analysis (common ground theory) and communities of practice and discuss design implications. In particular, we propose balancing the trade-off between knowledge reification and participation in representation-centric tools with the provision of social feedback and functionalities supporting meaning negotiation.",20160501,"Iandoli, Luca ; Quinto, Ivana ; De Liddo, Anna ; Buckingham Shum, Simon",Article,Academic Journal,May2016,true,Journal of the Association for Information Science & Technology,Computer software ; Online information services ; World Wide Web ; Data analysis ; Conversation ; Interprofessional relations ; Probability theory ; Statistics ; One-way analysis of variance,JOUR,,,2330-1635,,,,,eng,Wiley-Blackwell,1067,1052,16,67,5,10.1002/asi.23481,,H6JN,,https://research.ebsco.com/linkprocessor/plink?id=5a76764b-b03d-3582-8970-097baae3e21b
"Library, Information Science & Technology Abstracts",lxh,113219798,Interviews with digital seniors: ICT use in the context of everyday life.,"The literature on the digital divide suggests that seniors continue to lag behind in access to the Internet, digital skills, and engagement in various online activities. Much of the research, however, gains insight from large-scale survey research and neglects to examine the challenges and opportunities that digital seniors, those who are connected, experience in their everyday use of information and communication technologies (ICTs). We employed the theoretical lens of ICT use in the context of everyday life to inform this study. Twenty-one digital seniors (60 +) took part in interviews about how ICTs influenced their routines and practices such as news consumption, library use, information seeking, and reading. The interviews were transcribed and analyzed using grounded theory. Three key findings emerged. First, digital seniors are developing new practices and routines around their ICT use; these are novel and emerge out of ICTs’ affordances. Second, digital seniors are creatinghybrid practices, where they seamlessly combine traditional habits with new ones emerging from ICT use. Finally, digital seniors are recreating existing practices with digital means, i.e. the digital enhances or sometimes even replaces traditional practices. We find that agency is central to our understanding of digital seniors’ adoption and use of ICTs, they critically consider various options, and make choices around their preferences, convenience of use, and affordability. For digital seniors, ICT use is not a binary because they want to have the flexibility to choose for themselves under what circumstances and for what purposes the use of ICTs is appropriate.",20160501,"Quan-Haase, Anabel ; Martin, Kim ; Schreurs, Kathleen",Article,Academic Journal,May2016,true,"Information, Communication & Society",Digital divide ; Information & communication technologies ; Attitudes of library users ; Technology & older people ; Grounded theory,JOUR,,,1369-118X,,,,,eng,Taylor & Francis Ltd,707,691,17,19,5,10.1080/1369118X.2016.1140217,,5BA,,https://research.ebsco.com/linkprocessor/plink?id=46c4f603-99a1-30b0-a142-105d00596ab3

Phreaking the party line from operators to occupy.,"Contemporary networked social movements are characterized by their innovative use of mobile phones, the Internet, and social media to coordinate collective action. From 2011 to 2012, I conducted an ethnographic study of a group of Occupy protesters called InterOccupy, who scheduled and moderated 2000 movement-wide conference calls. Drawing on the history of telephones, I clarify why the Occupy movement utilized conference calls to organize mobilizations during an intense period of police repression. I locate InterOccupy within the history of conference calls to draw out the affordances of conference systems as tools for convening distributed groups in real time. Tethering InterOccupy to the history of telephone operators from the 1920s to 1960s, who used switchboards to manage shared party lines, with the phone phreaks of the 1960s–1980s, hackers who explored the telephone network, illustrates how each group used similar tools, techniques, and protocols to form communities across vast distances. Using a webinar system to link up to 500 callers, InterOccupy were guided by the ethics of phone phreaks to open lines of communication coupled with the methods of telephone operators to bring voices together.

The learning is supported by information affordances including a wiki learning management system (LMS) housing the curriculum, organized design activities, social media features, tutorials and informational assignments. Students engage in a Constructionist blended learning setting in their classroom, and work collaboratively in teams on game design. The study draws on qualitative video data from six team cases using a coding scheme of categories for the concepts of task, collaborative information seeking (CIS) Modality, and inquiry resolution outcomes. The study also considers linkages between processes and learning outcomes. Variation in engagement across the categories among students was charted, and certain patterns emerged. Findings indicate that some categories of task appear related to some categories of students’ chosen CIS Modality for solving problems. Further, CIS processes in support of tasks appear related to inquiry incident resolution (resolved/unresolved). For student completion of advanced programming tasks in particular, we observe more frequent uses of the wiki-based LMS resources, and greater levels of challenge in fulfilling tasks. Results support existing work on these theoretical constructs in the information sciences, and lead to questions on how naturalistic emergence of CIS practices result from greater task knowledge, and whether learned CIS practices (as tasks in and of themselves) can yield project task knowledge gains. Findings of the study and the ongoing questions the work invites hold instructional design implications, and show how social constructivist educational contexts involving collaborative and information seeking and knowledge building among youth game designers can contribute to scholarly understanding of these processes more broadly in related project-based work contexts occurring among both youth and adults.",20160201,"Reynolds, Rebecca B.",Article,Academic Journal,Feb2016,true,Journal of Information Science,Education ; United States ; Middle school students ; Collaborative learning ; Student-centered learning ; Project method in teaching ; Video game design ; Learning management system,JOUR,,,0165-5515,,,,,eng,"Sage Publications, Ltd.",58,35,24,42,1,10.1177/0165551515614537,,INJ,,https://research.ebsco.com/linkprocessor/plink?id=986909dd-f389-3707-b9c0-a713e76ffd42

I explore the difficulties associated with its use to distribute videos through an analysis of a one-year ethnographic investigation of community, activist and fan video producers in the United States and UK. My analysis draws upon Actor-Network Theory and DeLanda's reading of Deleuze and Guatarri's concept of assemblages, and shows that while my informants were engaged in various processes to create and stabilize their video distribution assemblages, these were precarious as they were also subject to destabilizing processes resulting from their complex and contested nature. This situation often resulted in the producers being left with distribution assemblages which did not satisfy their goals. Framing the problematic aspects of their distribution practices in these terms shows that these aspects can not only be understood as resulting from the producers’ specific circumstances as they struggled with, for example, corporate interests, the limited affordances of the video hosting and social media platforms they used, or the social dynamics of which they were apart, but that they can also be understood more generally as arising from the processes of human-technology entanglements, providing an alternative perspective to previous studies.",20160201,"Hondros, John J.",Article,Academic Journal,Feb2016,true,"Information, Communication & Society",Internet ; Social media ; Video production & direction ; Actor-network theory ; Local mass media,JOUR,,,1369-118X,,,,,eng,Taylor & Francis Ltd,233,221,13,19,2,10.1080/1369118X.2015.1050439,,5BA,,https://research.ebsco.com/linkprocessor/plink?id=bc02d756-e204-3a0e-85f3-a44768c372b5

Drawing from prior research on situational interest, pedestrian navigation, and design affordances, the study was intended to (a) support the development of exhibit prototypes in transit stations and (b) build a theoretically grounded conjecture map of multi-stage visitor attention, including factors that support or discourage engagement in these settings. The team iteratively tested and refined two exhibit prototypes, collecting data through tracking and timing, naturalistic observation, and structured interviews. The final conjecture map posits three stages of attention and situational interest, an underlying appraisal process guiding movement across these stages, and specific environment-person factors relevant at each stage. Findings also suggest several critical differences in designing for attention and interest in transit centers given the importance of mental schemas and social norms in navigation and choice. These results, although specific to the local context of the study, provide researchers and practitioners with frameworks to build upon with regard to audience attention and engagement and the design of informal learning experiences in public spaces.",20160101,"Cardiel, Christopher L.

This not only means that new media is changing the nature of listeners/viewers, transforming them into interactive users, but also that radio publics, once organized into networks, may have different properties, different behaviours and different values. In this paper, we have employed Digital Methods (DM) (Rogers, R. [2009].The end of the virtual. Amsterdam: Amsterdam University Press) and social network analysis to understand the Twitter activity and the communicative dynamics of the audiences of two Italian national radio stations: Radio3 Rai (public service station) and Radio Deejay (private commercial station). This work also aims to respond to a question asked by Rogers when defining DM: ‘Could the information contained in profiles on social networking sites provide different insights into the composition and characteristics of publics?’ (Rogers, R. [2009].The end of the virtual. Amsterdam: Amsterdam University Press). Based on the results that have emerged from this study, we believe that the answer can be affirmative: the analysis of the social connections and the interaction models of the networked listeners highlights new features of these audiences, and allows us to reevaluate and understand them from new points of view. This work shows that the digital audiences related to the two radio stations clearly distinguish themselves for their distinctive online behaviour and a different display of social networks, cultural capital and affect. We therefore hypothesize the presence of three different types of capital within the two different audiences analysed: social, cultural and affective capital.",20160101,"Bonini, Tiziano ; Caliandro, Alessandro ; Massarelli, Alessandra",Article,Academic Journal,Jan2016,true,"Information, Communication & Society",Radio broadcasting research ; Radio audiences ; Radio stations ; Online social networks research ; Social capital ; Cultural capital,JOUR,,,1369-118X,,,,,eng,Taylor & Francis Ltd,58,40,19,19,1,10.1080/1369118X.2015.1093532,,5BA,,https://research.ebsco.com/linkprocessor/plink?id=8d5dae92-5aaa-3df9-a5b7-80769f31afa4
"Library, Information Science & Technology Abstracts",lxh,5180176,Ontology and epistemology for agent-based wayfinding simulation.,"Agent-based systems are used to simulate the behaviour of people in various spatial environments. Designers of such systems need to give attention to ontological and epistemological concerns during the early stages of development to assure that the agent-based system is built upon a sound foundation. Only then is it possible to model the agent's behaviour in a cognitively plausible way. This paper describes an ecological approach to model ontology and epistemology for agent-based wayfinding simulation. The ontology of the wayfinding environment is based on a subdivision into medium, substances, and surfaces. The epistemological model uses the concept of affordances, which we divide into physical, social-institutional, and mental affordances. Ontology and epistemology are both grounded in people's descriptions of their wayfinding experiences. A case study of wayfinding in airports is used to demonstrate the applicability of the method for designing a simulation with a cognizing agent.",20011001,"Raubal, Martin",Article,Academic Journal,Oct2001,true,International Journal of Geographical Information Science,Geographic information systems ; Computer simulation ; Airports,JOUR,,,1365-8816,,,,,eng,Taylor & Francis Ltd,665,653,13,15,7,10.1080/13658810110061171,,B7P,,https://research.ebsco.com/linkprocessor/plink?id=2bd640ed-4d02-3593-93db-66d4f93d11c6
"Library, Information Science & Technology Abstracts",lxh,109990074,Gender differences in the climate change communication on Twitter.,"Purpose – The purpose of this paper is to present a study about gender differences in the climate change communication on Twitter and in the use of affordances on Twitter. Design/methodology/approach – The data set consists of about 250,000 tweets and retweets for which the authors’ gender was identified. While content of tweets and hashtags used were analysed for common topics and specific contexts, the usernames that were proportionately more frequently mentioned by either male or female tweeters were coded according to the usernames’ stance in the climate change debate into convinced (that climate change is caused by humans), sceptics, neutrals and unclear groups, and according to the type or role of the user account (e.g. campaign, organization, private person). Findings – The results indicate that overall male and female tweeters use very similar language in their tweets, but clear differences were observed in the use of hashtags and usernames, with female tweeters mentioning significantly more campaigns and organizations with a convinced attitude towards anthropogenic impact on climate change, while male tweeters mention significantly more private persons and usernames with a sceptical stance. The differences were even greater when retweets and duplicate tweets by the same author were removed from the data, indicating how retweeting can significantly influence the results. Practical implications – On a theoretical level the results increase the understanding for how women and men view and engage with climate change. This has practical implications for organizations interested in developing communication strategies for reaching and engaging female and male audiences on Twitter. While female tweeters can be targeted via local campaigns and news media, male tweeters seem to follow more political and scientific information. The results from the present research also showed that more research about the meaning of retweeting is needed, as the authors have shown how retweets can have a significant impact on the results. Originality/value – The findings contribute towards increased understanding of both gender differences in the climate change debate and in social media use in general. Beyond that this research showed how retweeting may have a significant impact on research where tweets are used as a data source.",20151101,"Holmberg, Kim ; Hellsten, Iina",Article,Academic Journal,2015,true,Internet Research,Social media ; Gender differences (Psychology) ; Climate change ; Anthropogenic effects on nature ; Twitter (Web resource),JOUR,,,1066-2243,,,,,eng,Emerald Publishing Limited,828,811,18,25,5,10.1108/IntR-07-2014-0179,,58X,,https://research.ebsco.com/linkprocessor/plink?id=17899fea-bbbd-3518-93ec-6ea51cf525f7
"Library, Information Science & Technology Abstracts",lxh,109539512,Capability in the digital: institutional media management and its dis/contents.,"This paper explores how social media spaces are occupied, utilized and negotiated by the British Military in relation to the Ministry of Defence's concerns and conceptualizations of risk. It draws on data from the DUN Project to investigate the content and form of social media about defence through the lens of ‘capability’, a term that captures and describes the meaning behind multiple representations of the military institution. But ‘capability’ is also a term that we hijack and extend here, not only in relation to the dominant presence of ‘capability’ as a representational trope and the extent to which it is revealing of a particular management of social media spaces, but also in relation to what our research reveals for the wider digital media landscape and ‘capable’ digital methods. What emerges from our analysis is the existence of powerful, successful and critically long-standing media and reputation management strategies occurring within the techno-economic online structures where the exercising of ‘control’ over the individual – as opposed to the technology – is highly effective. These findings raise critical questions regarding the extent to which ‘control’ and management of social media – both within and beyond the defence sector – may be determined as much by cultural, social, institutional and political influence and infrastructure as the technological economies. At a key moment in social media analysis, then, when attention is turning to the affordances, criticisms and possibilities of data, our research is a pertinent reminder that we should not forget the active management of content that is being similarly, if not equally, effective.",20151101,"Maltby, Sarah ; Bennett, Daniel ; Thornham, Helen",Article,Academic Journal,Nov2015,true,"Information, Communication & Society",Social media & politics ; Communication education ; Communication & politics ; British military ; Strategic communication,JOUR,,,1369-118X,,,,,eng,Taylor & Francis Ltd,1296,1275,22,18,11,10.1080/1369118X.2015.1046893,,5BA,,https://research.ebsco.com/linkprocessor/plink?id=70594cf2-e342-3a44-8555-ff0becb64160

Based on a two-year multimodal ethnography of the Mexican #YoSoy132 movement, the article demonstrates that the concept of collective identity is still able to yield relevant insights into the study of current movements, especially in connection with the use of social media platforms. Through the appropriations of social media, Mexican students were able to oppose the negative identification fabricated by the PRI party, reclaim their agency and their role as heirs of a long tradition of rebellion, generate collective identification processes, and find ‘comfort zones’ to lower the costs of activism, reinforcing their internal cohesion and solidarity. The article stresses the importance of the internal communicative dynamics that develop in the backstage of social media (Facebook chats and groups) and through instant messaging services (WhatsApp), thus rediscovering the pivotal linkage between collective identity and internal communication that characterized the first wave of research on digital social movements. The findings point out how that internal cohesion and collective identity are fundamentally shaped and reinforced in the social media backstage by practices of ‘ludic activism’, which indicates that social media represent not only the organizational backbone of contemporary social movements, but also multifaceted ecologies where a new, expressive and humorous ‘communicative resistance grammar’ emerges.",20150801,"Treré, Emiliano",Article,Academic Journal,Aug2015,true,"Information, Communication & Society",Social media ; Technological innovations ; Instant messaging ; WhatsApp Inc. ; Social movements,JOUR,,,1369-118X,,,,,eng,Taylor & Francis Ltd,915,901,15,18,8,10.1080/1369118X.2015.1043744,,5BA,,https://research.ebsco.com/linkprocessor/plink?id=0218fdc3-027d-3d16-8cf7-2b49961cc886
"Library, Information Science & Technology Abstracts",lxh,103576862,From social movements to cloud protesting: the evolution of collective identity.,"This article develops a conceptual framework for understanding collective action in the age of social media, focusing on the role of collective identity and the process of its making. It is grounded on an interactionist approach that considers organized collective action as a social construct with communicative action at its core [Melucci, A. 1996.Challenging codes: Collective action in the information age. Cambridge, MA: Cambridge University Press]. It explains how micromobilization is mediated by social media, and argues that social media play a novel broker role in the activists' meaning construction processes. Social media impose precise material constraints on their social affordances, which have profound implications in both the symbolic production and organizational dynamics of social action. The materiality of social media deeply affects identity building, in two ways: firstly, it amplifies the ‘interactive and shared’ elements of collective identity (Melucci, 1996), and secondly, it sets in motion a politics of visibility characterized by individuality, performance, visibility, and juxtaposition. The politics of visibility, at the heart of what I call ‘cloud protesting’, exacerbates the centrality of the subjective and private experience of the individual in contemporary mobilizations, and has partially replaced the politics of identity typical of social movements. The politics of visibility creates individuals-in-the-group, whereby the ‘collective’ is experienced through the ‘individual’ and the group is the means of collective action, rather than its end.",20150801,"Milan, Stefania",Article,Academic Journal,Aug2015,true,"Information, Communication & Society",Telematics ; Social media ; Computer assisted instruction ; Social movements ; Group identity -- Social aspects,JOUR,,,1369-118X,,,,,eng,Taylor & Francis Ltd,900,887,14,18,8,10.1080/1369118X.2015.1043135,,5BA,,https://research.ebsco.com/linkprocessor/plink?id=9e960a14-ee76-39e7-abf0-fbd7bf0c86c7
"Library, Information Science & Technology Abstracts",lxh,103136553,Affective surfing in the visualized interface of a digital library for children.,"The uncertainty children experience when searching for information influences their information seeking behavior by stimulating curiosity or hindering their search efforts. This study explored the interactions and the usability of various search interfaces, and the enjoyment or uncertainty experienced by children when using them. Structural Equation Modeling was used to determine whether children feel uncertainty or a sense of control when using virtual game-like interfaces to search for information associated with entertainment or as a means to satisfy an assigned learning task. We then analyzed the weight relationships among three latent variables (information needs, interface media, and affective state) using statistical (path) analysis. Our results indicate that children prefer using a retrieval interface with situated affordance to satisfy entertainment-related information needs, as opposed to searching for information to solve specific problems. Furthermore, their perceptions of text and graphic icons determined the degree to which they experienced a sense of uncertainty or control. When searching for entertainment-related information, they were better able to deal with uncertainty and sought greater control in their search interface, compared to when they were searching for information related to assigned tasks. According to their information needs, children may regard a game-like interface as a toy or a tool for learning. The results of this study can serve as reference for the future development of information search interfaces aimed at arousing the interest of children. The use of virtual game-like interfaces to guide the IS behavior of children warrants further study.",20150701,"Wu, Ko-Chiu",Article,Academic Journal,Jul2015,true,Information Processing & Management,Digital libraries ; Data mining ; Surfing ; Child services ; Structural equation modeling,JOUR,,,0306-4573,,,,,eng,Elsevier B.V.,390,373,18,51,4,10.1016/j.ipm.2015.02.005,,INM,,https://research.ebsco.com/linkprocessor/plink?id=84a941e0-2da0-3de0-9536-52bc59a70e25
"Library, Information Science & Technology Abstracts",lxh,102417016,Taxonomy of literacies.,"Purpose – Digital technologies have transformed what it means to be literate and to experience literacy. Various literacies have been coined to capture this transformation including established literacies like computer literacy, information literacy, digital literacy, media literacy and internet literacy, to newer conceptions like transliteracy, metaliteracy and multimodal literacy. The purpose of this paper is to assimilate the various conceptions of literacy and literacy types is becoming increasingly more complex. There is a need for a taxonomy of literacies that reflects more recent developments, one that more comprehensively captures the current literacy landscape and one that might have affordances in the future. Design/methodology/approach – “Library and Information Science Abstracts” (LISA), “Education Resources Information Center” (ERIC) and “British Education Index” were searched for documents relating to digital technologies and literacy. Relevant documents were retrieved and reviewed. This was followed by selective backward and forward citation searching and a further review of relevant documents. Findings – Based on a review of the literature, two significant dimensions of literacy were identified. These dimensions were used to create a literacy framework to enable the classification of literacies and literacy types, i.e. a taxonomy of literacies. This taxonomy was successfully applied to various prominent literacies and literacy types. Research limitations/implications – The literacy framework was only applied to those literacies and literacy types that are directly or indirectly related to digital technologies. Originality/value – There have been a few attempts to classify some literacy types. When conceived, these classifications comprehensively captured some aspect of the literacy landscape. However, they are now dated and there is a need for a taxonomy of literacies that meets the needs identified above.

"Library, Information Science & Technology Abstracts",lxh,101712646,Strategies of control: workers’ use of ICTs to shape knowledge and service work.,"This paper examines the way that different types of workers deploy strategies of control in concert with and in resistance to information and communication technologies (ICTs). Existing research on the effects of ICTs for knowledge workers has illustrated the ways they can lead to practices of overwork and work–life spillover. However, the dearth of studies on service workers and ICT means that we have a limited understanding of their role across different segments of the workforce. Drawing on interviews with service workers and knowledge workers, I examine how they use ICTs to shape their experiences of work. The study finds the two groups deployed ICTs in different ways, and employed different ICT-centric strategies to control the temporal and emotional demands of their labor. The service workers deployed strategies of everyday resistance in concert with their ICTs to gain a feeling of autonomy within the power structures of their workplaces. The knowledge workers deployed strategies of inaccessibility to resist the work-extending affordances of their devices and decouple from work which threatened to colonize too much of their lives. Both service and knowledge workers deploy strategies that may obscure the institutional sources of their problems by overindividualizing risk and responsibility. The paper concludes by calling for a broader empirical research agenda and more comparative research oriented to understanding the ways that ICTs both enable and constrain workers confronting different work conditions and demands.",20150501,"Ticona, Julia",Article,Academic Journal,May2015,true,"Information, Communication & Society",Communication ; Cybernetics ; Work values ; Communication strategies ; Scientific method,JOUR,,,1369-118X,,,,,eng,Taylor & Francis Ltd,523,509,15,18,5,10.1080/1369118X.2015.1012531,,5BA,,https://research.ebsco.com/linkprocessor/plink?id=fc521267-361b-3a12-afac-210d2c590505

Although previous studies indicated that virtual worlds would be helpful for experiential and collaborative learning through enhancing physical and social presence, few studies have investigated what determines physical and social presence and what are their roles in learning and teaching in virtual worlds. The current study investigates the influences of individual differences such as age, gender, and epistemological beliefs on physical and social presence. This study also investigates the influences of physical and social presence on situational interest and perceived achievement in virtual role-play. The role-play activity allowed pre-service teachers ( n = 151) to teach their peers in realistic classroom contexts within Second Life and to reflect on their language use as teachers. This study found that pre-service teachers' age and epistemological beliefs significantly influenced their physical and social presence in the virtual world. This finding implies that physical and social presence are influenced not only by the representational fidelity of virtual worlds but also by individual differences. In addition, physical and social presence positively influenced situational interest and perceived achievement.

Situating the research in a broader context in which non-dominant teens are increasingly surveilled, I demonstrate how teens manage social privacy in at least three ways. First, they negotiate liminal boundaries of what constitutes a communal or shareable mobile device, which are structured around financial constraints. Second, through nonuse, they actively resist the ways mobile and social media reconfigure social and physical spaces. Third, they deliberately use multiple platforms as a way to cope with evolving privacy settings, social norms, and technological affordances; this is a deliberate strategy intended to resist social convergence.

A coding scheme incorporating the Technological Pedagogical Content Knowledge (TPACK) framework guided the analysis of pre-service teachers’ Web 2.0-enhanced learning activity descriptions. The results indicated that while pre-service teachers were able to consider various Web 2.0 tools for teaching, the technologies regularly used in their programmes and observed at their placement schools seemed to influence their choice. Although the majority of the pre-service teachers lacked the knowledge to relate the affordances of Web 2.0 to teaching particular content, 3D-Exploring tools were more intuitive to designing learning activities across a range of subjects.

"Library, Information Science & Technology Abstracts",lxh,99850660,In Jimmy Governor's archive.,"This article examines a selection of archival records created and preserved in relation to the Aboriginal outlaw Jimmy Governor. It focuses in particular upon a special diary kept by the officers guarding him during his time in the condemned cell at Darlinghurst Gaol in 1900-01. The article considers these records and the various microfilm and digital surrogates used by scholars in terms of the affordances of their specific materiality. It advances an argument about how these particular archival records function as evidence of law, duty and public administration. Whereas in the past Jimmy Governor's story has primarily been told in the genre of law-breaking, this article argues that these archival records instead reveal him as an agent of lawmaking. When examined as pages and as paper, the various documents that comprise the Jimmy Governor archive provide evidence of a commitment to the rule of law in a colonial society on the brink of Federation.",20141101,"Biber, Katherine",Article,Academic Journal,Nov2014,true,Archives & Manuscripts,"Archival materials ; Authorship ; Australia ; Legal history ; Diary (Literary form) ; Prisoners ; Twentieth century ; Governor, Jimmy",JOUR,,,0157-6895,,,,,eng,Australian Society of Archivists,281,270,12,42,3,10.1080/01576895.2014.961023,,W6Q,,https://research.ebsco.com/linkprocessor/plink?id=930f1e85-4588-3c85-86a0-a141b7255d1b

In particular, Facebook users have maximized the platform to commemorate the dead, thereby forming communal digital mourning. Hence, this paper investigates how Filipinos foster an online community through their online practices of the Filipino concept of pakikipagkapwa [one-of-us] in pakikiramay and pakikidalamhati. Guided by Virgilio Enriquez's Sikolohiyang Pilipino (Filipino psychology) and Rotman and Preece's (2010) characteristics of online communities, this paper investigated 593 posts from 24 memorialized Facebook accounts using textual analysis. Findings reveal that pakikiramay [sympathizing with another] and pakikidalamhati [sharing the burden of mourning] expressed through practicing death rituals using the technological affordances of Facebook demonstrate that the bereaved has maintained company with the departed in life and in death (""I have been with you, and I will always be with you""). Communal digital grief affirms that the bereaved are never alone while in mourning (""We are together in mourning"").",20230401,"Venzon, Shaira Kristine ; Gopilan, David Matthew",Article,Academic Journal,Apr2023,true,First Monday,Virtual communities ; Content analysis ; Rites & ceremonies ; Bereavement ; Filipinos,JOUR,,,1396-0466,,,,,eng,First Monday,1,1,1,28,4,10.5210/fm.v28i4.12740,,DZZ,,https://research.ebsco.com/linkprocessor/plink?id=97149fa1-5ab0-3421-818e-26b5780a1f6e

Students are likely to own smartphones and tablets and instructors are faced with the challenge of integrating mobile devices into their course activities, whether as a full delivery medium, an enhancement or an optional tool. The M-COPE framework prompts instructors to consider five critical areas related to mobile learning: Mobile affordances, Conditions, Outcomes, Pedagogy and Ethics. This framework can be integrated with any instructional design process to help instructors engage in the informed design of mobile learning activities. This paper presents the framework and how it can be used with the ADDIE model of instructional design, and provides two case examples of how M-COPE influenced the success of two mobile learning activities.",20141001,"Dennen, Vanessa P. ; Hao, Shuang",Article,Academic Journal,Oct2014,true,"Technology, Pedagogy & Education",Educational technology ; Universities & colleges ; Mobile learning ; Computers in higher education ; College teaching methodology ; Higher education,JOUR,,,1475-939X,,,,,eng,Taylor & Francis Ltd,419,397,23,23,3,10.1080/1475939X.2014.943278,,131K,,https://research.ebsco.com/linkprocessor/plink?id=89ef6d08-79d9-32b9-a3a4-37f72cedba05

Schön’s views on design and how it could inform design-based research (DBR) on teachers’ use of technology in education. It argues that the rich affordances of digital technologies and teachers’ and students’ situated designs with such technologies in complex and changing educational contexts make viewing design as rational problem-solving problematic. Instead, it is suggested that adopting Schön’s view ofdesign as a reflective conversation with the situationin DBR approaches has the potential of informing both research on the use of digital educational technologies and teachers’ situated use of such technologies. The paper then presents suggestions as to how Schön’s ideas for research on teachers’ situated practices could contribute to theory development in DBR.

It was thought that the portability and flexibility of these devices would allow staff to reach students and help them at their point of need. To test out this premise, an action study was carried out to examine the use of tablets and their suitability in facilitating the roving librarian project as well as evaluate roving as a vehicle for teaching information literacy on the move. Data was collected through peer observation, individual reflections, and a questionnaire conducted with subject librarians to find out more regarding their usage of the tablet and to ascertain whether they have found it conducive in roving. The project demonstrated that the affordances of both devices enabled librarians to provide personalized mobile help to students whilst building stronger relationships and arguably having the type of conversations about library resources and facilities that would not have happened if staff had stayed within the physical library building.",20140501,"Sharman, Alison",Article,Academic Journal,May2014,true,New Review of Academic Librarianship,Tablet computers ; Librarians ; Information science ; Libraries ; Library applications ; Activity programs in education ; Public buildings,JOUR,,,1361-4533,,,,,eng,Taylor & Francis Ltd,203,185,19,20,2,10.1080/13614533.2014.914959,,RFW,,https://research.ebsco.com/linkprocessor/plink?id=e33a44e9-aafe-3de4-849a-0c8a75c94a83

The current wave of globalization and the integration of the world economy have intensified international trade volumes. Thus, the prospect of development through trade has driven some countries sub‐Saharan Africa to adopt information and communication technologies (ICTs), particularly electronic data interchange (EDI) to facilitate international trade. This paper applies Amartya Sen's Capability Approach (CA) as a framework to examine the effect of an e‐government initiative intended to modernise customs operational procedures and facilitate trade. E‐trade facilitation has given individuals and businesses the opportunity to lodge import and exports declarations electronically with a single document, resulting in time and cost savings as declarations can be made electronically from any location and at any time. The paper makes a contribution by offering a useful example of the affordances of the CA for examining e‐government initiatives particularly in developing countries focusing on what people can actually do with the opportunities provided by e‐government, rather than using income‐based measures.",20140401,"Adaba, Godfried Bakiyem ; Rusu, Lazar",Article,Academic Journal,Apr2014,true,Electronic Journal of Information Systems in Developing Countries,,JOUR,,,1681-4835,,,,,eng,Wiley-Blackwell,13,1,13,63,1,10.1002/j.1681-4835.2014.tb00450.x,,1D48,,https://research.ebsco.com/linkprocessor/plink?id=963168f6-7cbc-39c7-aeb5-2f1ff870b0a2

Digital technology has revolutionised the way people learn and gather new information. This trend has challenged the role of the library as a physical place, as well as the interplay of digital and physical aspects of the library. The paper provides an overview of how the penetration of digital technology into everyday life has affected the library as a place, both as designed by placemakers and as perceived by library users. It then identifies a gap in current library research about the use of digital technology as a tool for placemaking, and reports results from a study of Gelatine -- a custom-built user check-in system that displays real-time user information on a set of public screens. Gelatine and its evaluation at The Edge, at the State Library of Queensland, illustrates how combining affordances of social, spatial and digital space can improve the connected learning experience among on-site visitors.

What library sources do patrons want made available to them electronically? The method used in the study was an online survey. Key findings were that half of respondents regularly read journal articles on a computer screen and one in five regularly reads or listens to e-books in their academic work. Seven out of ten participants stated that they would like libraries to provide reference works, Bible commentaries, circulating titles, and textbooks in electronic format. Students consistently embraced e-reading and library resources in electronic formats at a higher rate than instructors. The distinction between library-owned resources and those owned by an individual disappeared in the minds of many respondents. They wanted library-owned electronic resources to provide affordances (e.g., annotation functions) never found in print books.

I first use Morris's history of traditional gravescapes to situate digital memorials within their broader historical context. I then draw on the functional genre of eulogies, in particular Jamieson and Campbell's systematic description of eulogies, as a textual analytic to understand Facebook's unique memorializing discourse. My analysis suggests that the affordances of the Internet allow for a peculiar dynamic wherein the bereaved engage in communication with the deceased instead of with each other and yet strengthen the communal experience, as their personal communications are visible to the entire community.

Technological and Conceptual Connectivity in Kenya's BPO and Software Development Sectors.,"Abstract: This is a paper about expectations surrounding a potentially highly transformative moment in East Africa's history: the arrival of underwater fibre‐optic broadband communications cables into the Indian Ocean port of Mombasa. It combines a media content analysis with findings from interviews with business owners in Kenya's nascent business process outsourcing (BPO) and software development sectors in order to explore how such moments of technological ‘connectivity’ are imagined, marketed and enacted within economic development. It argues that connectivity is not just a matter of boosting physical/material capacity but also about redressing conceptual connectivity; bringing places ‘closer together’ involves rehabilitating the images of places in peoples’ minds and removing imagined senses of distance. As such, technologies of connectivity are marketed not just as tools of altered communications affordances, but more importantly, as momentary opportunities for revisiting the image of places from afar. Additionally, the cables reveal the importance of fostering internal linkages in order to better build international recognition and connections. ‘Moments of expectation’ that surround new ICT technologies reveal how discourse and representation play a strong role in enabling markets to form and change. The very idea of ‘connectivity’ itself is driving plans and policies throughout the region.",20130401,"Graham, Mark ; Mann, Laura",Article,Academic Journal,Apr2013,true,Electronic Journal of Information Systems in Developing Countries,,JOUR,,,1681-4835,,,,,eng,Wiley-Blackwell,19,1,19,56,1,10.1002/j.1681-4835.2013.tb00396.x,,1D48,,https://research.ebsco.com/linkprocessor/plink?id=1c698495-cc8f-3fa8-9d7c-d829b3776ca2
"Library, Information Science & Technology Abstracts",lxh,84362939,Application of the task-technology fit model to structure and evaluate the adoption of E-books by Academics.,"Increasingly, e-books are becoming alternatives to print books in academic libraries, thus providing opportunities to assess how well the use of e-books meets the requirements of academics. This study uses the task-technology fit ( TTF) model to explore the interrelationships of e-books, the affordances offered by smart readers, the information needs of academics, and the 'fit' of technology to tasks as well as performance. We propose that the adoption of e-books will be dependent on how academics perceive the fit of this new medium to the tasks they undertake as well as what added-value functionality is delivered by the information technology that delivers the content. The study used content analysis and an online survey, administered to the faculty in Medicine, Science and Engineering at the University of New South Wales, to identify the attributes of a TTF construct of e-books in academic settings. Using exploratory factor analysis, preliminary findings confirmed annotation, navigation, and output as the core dimensions of the TTF construct. The results of confirmatory factor analysis using partial least squares path modeling supported the overall TTF model in reflecting significant positive impact of task, technology, and individual characteristics on TTF for e-books in academic settings; it also confirmed significant positive impact of TTF on individuals' performance and use, and impact of using e-books on individual performance. Our research makes two contributions: the development of an e-book TTF construct and the testing of that construct in a model validating the efficacy of the TTF framework in measuring perceived fit of e-books to academic tasks.",20130101,"D'Ambra, John ; Wilson, Concepción S. ; Akter, Shahriar",Article,Academic Journal,Jan2013,true,Journal of the American Society for Information Science & Technology,Universities & colleges ; Academic libraries ; Content analysis ; Experimental design ; Factor analysis ; Research methodology ; Publishing ; Surveys ; Textbooks ; Electronic publications ; Information needs ; Australia ; Diffusion of innovations ; Mathematical models ; Research funding ; Theory ; Descriptive statistics,JOUR,,,1532-2882,,,,,eng,Wiley-Blackwell,64,48,17,64,1,10.1002/asi.22757,,IGD,,https://research.ebsco.com/linkprocessor/plink?id=c962f10a-ede8-3b8a-84a8-ad055799b183

The lenses are simply thin sheets of paper or transparent foil decorated with fiducial markers, allowing them to be tracked by a diffuse illumination tabletop display. The physical affordance of these embodied lenses allow them to be overlapped, causing composition in the underlying virtual space. We perform a formative evaluation to study users’ conceptual models for overlapping physical lenses. This is followed by a quantitative user study comparing performance for embodied versus purely virtual lenses. Results show that embodied lenses are as efficient as purely virtual lenses, and also support tactile and eyes-free interaction. We then present several examples of the technique, including image layers, map layers, image manipulation, and multidimensional data visualization.

It departs from a pre-defined network (in a secondary school in Flanders, Belgium) and investigates how friendship type and clique formation (an important dynamic in this (micro) context) are related to face-to-face communication (FTFC) and the use of email, instant messaging, text messaging, telephone and social network sites in this network. Hypotheses/expectations were derived from network theory and (qualitative and quantitative) studies on the social affordances of communication technologies for adolescents. Data were collected among the 78 pupils of a fourth grade (15–16-year-olds) in a Belgian secondary school. First, dyadic quadratic assignment procedure regression analyses were run to explain the frequency of FTFC and communication through different technologies by looking at dyad characteristics (strength of ties, number of friends in common, same sex…). Second, FTFC and communication through technologies were compared for in-group versus out-group ties. The analyses show that the patterns of FTFC were sometimes reproduced (and therefore extended), and sometimes deviated from in communication through technologies.

The authors aim to introduce MobiTOP (Mobile Tagging of Objects and People), a mobile annotation system that allows users to contribute and share geospatial multimedia annotations via mobile devices. Design/methodology/approach – Field observations and interviews were conducted. A group of trainee teachers involved in a geography field study were instructed to identify rock formations by collaborating with each other using the MobiTOP system. The trainee teachers who were in the field were guided by their lab counterparts on the tasks required to identify the rock formations. Findings – Participants were able to appreciate the fieldwork task as it augmented their classroom lessons. The system allowed them to communicate with one another in order to meet the objectives of the study. However, there were some technical difficulties in relation to the affordance of the mobile and web applications that affected the usefulness of the applications.

"Library, Information Science & Technology Abstracts",lxh,77657768,THE TENSION BETWEEN PROFESSIONAL CONTROL AND OPEN PARTICIPATION.,"Amid growing difficulties for professionals generally, media workers in particular are negotiating the increasingly contested boundary space between producers and users in the digital environment. This article, based on a review of the academic literature, explores that larger tension transforming the creative industries by extrapolating from the case of journalism – namely, the ongoing tension between professional control and open participation in the news process. Firstly, the sociology of professions, with its emphasis on boundary maintenance, is used to examine journalism as boundary work, profession, and ideology – each contributing to the formation of journalism's professional logic of control over content. Secondly, by considering the affordances and cultures of digital technologies, the article articulates open participation and its ideology. Thirdly, and against this backdrop of ideological incompatibility, a review of empirical literature finds that journalists have struggled to reconcile this key tension, caught in the professional impulse toward one-way publishing control even as media become a multi-way network. Yet, emerging research also suggests the possibility of a hybrid logic of adaptability and openness – an ethic of participation – emerging to resolve this tension going forward. The article concludes by pointing to innovations in analytical frameworks and research methods that may shed new light on the producer–user tension in journalism.",20120801,"Lewis, Seth C.",Article,Academic Journal,Aug2012,true,"Information, Communication & Society",Digital technology ; Sociology of professions ; Cultural industries ; Journalism ; Participation ; Ideology,JOUR,,,1369-118X,,,,,eng,Taylor & Francis Ltd,866,836,31,15,6,10.1080/1369118X.2012.674150,,5BA,,https://research.ebsco.com/linkprocessor/plink?id=a3936d9d-64c5-3eb5-9b2b-48562db08b32
"Library, Information Science & Technology Abstracts",lxh,79358905,In Print or On Screen? Investigating the Reading Habits of Undergraduate Students Using Photo-Diaries and Photo-Interviews.,"This study explores the decision-making process that students engage in when choosing between reading texts in print or on screen. This issue is of key importance to planners and policy makers in libraries and universities at large, but has never been investigated systematically. This quantitative study has a research population of twelve undergraduate students and uses photo-diaries, documenting reading behaviour over three days, followed by individual photo-interviews. The study initially establishes an inventory of perceived advantages and disadvantages of reading in print versus on screen. These perceived advantages and disadvantages are weighted by importance and subdivided into five categories: attitudes, economic factors, physical health and wellbeing, affordances, and engagement with text. Using this framework, the importance of each of these factors on readers' actual choices is assessed for both study-related and leisure reading, and across a broad range of document types. Particular focus is on the role of attitudes in the decision-making process. The research also highlights the seriousness of distraction caused by computers when reading on screen; a problem largely ignored or underrated in current research and literature. The study demonstrates how the application of visual sociology methods -- and in particularly the use of digital cameras -- can be employed successfully in library and reading research to document reading behaviour, to prompt readers to recall their experiences, to reflect on their reading behaviour, and to express their attitudes and beliefs.",20120301,,Article,Academic Journal,Mar2012,true,Libri: International Journal of Libraries & Information Services,Reading ; Library administration ; Decision making ; Attitude (Psychology) ; College students ; Study skills,JOUR,,,0024-2667,,,,,eng,De Gruyter,18,1,18,62,1,10.1515/libri-2012-0001,,9ZQ,,https://research.ebsco.com/linkprocessor/plink?id=124a6ed1-7770-3518-bc03-37a7adde0587

Towards the automatic discovery of place-related services and activities.,"The current web is rich in geographically referenced data. Mining, retrieving and sharing these data raises the need for rich geographical place name resources that record spatial and thematic elements of geographical places. Here, possible services offered at a place and human activities that can be practised there are considered useful concepts to discover and encode in place name resources. Recognising this dimension of place description can enhance information retrieval tasks by extending the range of possible queries and search criteria that relate to different place instances. This work proposes an automatic approach for the identification and extraction of service and activity-related concepts from multiple resources of textual descriptions of geographical place types. Frequent affordance patterns are identified and then applied to a corpus of resources to extract service and activity types associated with specific geographical place types.

It reports on an investigation into teens' experiences in the United States, as they use information to learn how to create content and participate within the context of social media. Teens that participate in sharing art on sites such as DeviantArt, website creation, blogging, and/or posing edited videos via YouTube and Vimeo, were interviewed.

A standard Google-like list interface was compared to a tabular interface that presented search results grouped according to objective, subjective, or commercial information in order to provide users with affordances for source evaluations. Results revealed that university students using the tabular interface paid less visual attention to commercial search results and selected objective search results more often and commercial ones less often than students using the list interface. Furthermore, the epistemic belief that the Web contains (among other types of information) correct knowledge was related to an increased selection of objective search results and to longer fixations on non-selected search results. Moreover, epistemic beliefs moderated the effects of the search interface, such that students with strong beliefs that the Web contains correct knowledge showed a more focused information selection and better search outcomes in terms of their argumentative summaries when using the tabular interface than when using the list interface.

"Library, Information Science & Technology Abstracts",lxh,67327417,MUSLIMS ON THE PATH OF THE SALAF AL-SALIH.,"The transfer of religious rituals into computer-mediated environments (CMEs) has attracted the attention of scholars in recent years. This article aims to contribute to this field by analysing the ritual dynamics in Dutch and German chat rooms as well as Internet discussion forums popular among Muslims following the Salafiyya. Two questions stand in the centre of the analysis: How are rituals transferred to new CMEs? And what accounts for the varying success of transfer processes? Religious rituals are understood to be successful when they (a) reproduce the core values and norms of a community; (b) involve a significant number of believers; and (c) protect the sacred from the profane. The ritual landscape of a religion undergoes a transformation in the course of the transfer process with mixed results: some rituals like the Muslim conversion ritual migrate successfully while other transfer processes yield ambiguous results, as the discussion of the ritual acts of gender segregation shows. Furthermore, in the case of some rituals like the Muslim prayer, a migration is not even attempted, while, on the other hand, some religious practices can become increasingly ritualized in the new environment and enter the ritual repertoire of a community. This contribution argues that the diverse outcomes of ritual transfer processes are partly the result of the interplay between affordances of CMEs and the exigencies of ritual segments.",20111201,"Becker, Carmen",Article,Academic Journal,Dec2011,true,"Information, Communication & Society",Internet ; Telematics ; Online chat ; Technology & religion ; Religious aspects ; Ritual ; Muslims ; Islamic prayers & devotions,JOUR,,,1369-118X,,,,,eng,Taylor & Francis Ltd,1203,1181,23,14,8,10.1080/1369118X.2011.597414,,5BA,,https://research.ebsco.com/linkprocessor/plink?id=a7719425-04c6-309a-b595-7cee1c53af88
"Library, Information Science & Technology Abstracts",lxh,67327416,PATTERNS OF BELONGING IN ONLINE/OFFLINE INTERFACES OF RELIGION.,"This article explores patterns of belonging that may develop around religious activities in the interface of online and offline settings. This article is a theoretical contribution aiming to develop fruitful concepts for use at the present stage of research on religion and the Internet. With reference to Lorne Dawson's note on ‘Religion and the quest for virtual community’ from 2004, this article discusses conceptual consequences following recent changes in the Internet as well as changes in offline and online religion and religiosity. It is argued that online patterns should be considered in relation to offline structures. Religion is understood through processes of mediation and patterns of belonging rather than as defined ‘communities’. A sense of belonging is upheld in the intertwined processes of interaction and identification. Patterns of religious belonging gathered from offline contexts as well as from online practices are better suited to trace religion and religiosity in the new media environment than either an existing religious offline community or an expected ‘virtual’ counterpart. The author suggests a typology where patterns of religious belonging could be traced either as ‘participatory’ or ‘vicarious’, online or offline, respectively. The Internet – in the open exchange between the online and the offline – offers new ways for religion to happen. The Internet, as available with the affordances of social media, is not antithetical to being religious. Rather, forms of religion and religiosity are shaped through the interplay of mediation and belonging at the offline/online interface.",20111201,"Lundby, Knut",Article,Academic Journal,Dec2011,true,"Information, Communication & Society","Internet ; Virtual communities ; Technology & religion ; Religious aspects ; Religiousness ; Rites & ceremonies ; Dawson, Lorne",JOUR,,,1369-118X,,,,,eng,Taylor & Francis Ltd,1235,1219,17,14,8,10.1080/1369118X.2011.594077,,5BA,,https://research.ebsco.com/linkprocessor/plink?id=71277611-053e-3158-b64c-7260c6498ee4
"Library, Information Science & Technology Abstracts",lxh,63627252,DIGITAL MEDIA AND THE PERSONALIZATION OF COLLECTIVE ACTION.,"Changes related to globalization have resulted in the growing separation of individuals in late modern societies from traditional bases of social solidarity such as parties, churches, and other mass organizations. One sign of this growing individualization is the organization of individual action in terms of meanings assigned to lifestyle elements resulting in the personalization of issues such as climate change, labour standards, and the quality of food supplies. Such developments bring individuals' own narratives to the fore in the mobilization process, often requiring organizations to be more flexible in their definitions of issues. This personalization of political action presents organizations with a set of fundamental challenges involving potential trade-offs between flexibility and effectiveness. This paper analyses how different protest networks used digital media to engage individuals in mobilizations targeting the 2009 G20 London Summit during the global financial crisis. The authors examine how these different communication processes affected the political capacity of the respective organizations and networked coalitions. In particular, the authors explore whether the coalition offering looser affiliation options for individuals displays any notable loss of public engagement, policy focus (including mass media impact), or solidarity network coherence. This paper also examines whether the coalition offering more rigid collective action framing and fewer personalized social media affordances displays any evident gain in the same dimensions of mobilization capacity. In this case, the evidence suggests that the more personalized collective action process maintains high levels of engagement, agenda focus, and network strength.",20110901,"Bennett, W.

The considerations for developing a service are primarily defined as relating to budget, staffing, and usability. Text reference is characterized as somewhere between synchronous and asynchronous, increasing in volume, and mostly concerned with short, straightforward questions and answers. These factors all influence adherence to RUSA guidelines for behavioral performance of reference librarians, but are not insurmountable.

Situated within the framework of contemporary virtual worlds, this paper aims to provide insight into the possibility of Traveler's potential influence on next-generation virtual communities. Specifically, we look at how Second Life's indigenous prosumer culture unconsciously reflects upon Traveler's creation of 3D objects and architectural environments as expressive extensions of identity and social space that together create a blurred boundary between individual avicentrism and community. Retrospectively, beyond Second Life and its infrastructural cousins, the avicentric design affordances of Traveler revolved around an integrated fusion of both oral transmission protocols and concentrated facial communication by head-shaped avatars for the purpose of embodied story-telling.

"Library, Information Science & Technology Abstracts",lxh,76336399,Investigating the extent to which mobile phones reduce Knowledge Transfer barriers in Student Project Teams.,"Group learning plays a key role in the transfer of knowledge. In institutions of learning, it enhances students' understanding, critical thinking, integration of knowledge and knowledge sharing. However, the transfer of knowledge in group projects is often impeded by factors such as time and budget constraints, individual and social barriers, and a lack of motivation. Institutions of learning are increasingly adopting information and communication technologies (e.g. mobile technologies) to provide solutions to the challenges facing them. Whilst the integration of the mobile context and technologies in learning environment has been encouraged over the years, and indeed many students today can use mobile phones, the effectiveness of these technologies in reducing impediments to knowledge transfer in group learning has not been investigated. This study investigated the extent to which mobile phones reduce the barriers to knowledge transfer in project groups. The impediments examined include the nature of knowledge, social barriers, lack of time and lack of motivation. Quantitative and qualitative approaches were used to collect and analyse the data. The sample consisted of 85 students engaged in group projects in the departments of Information Systems, Civil Engineering, Computer Science and Construction Engineering. The results show that mobile phones reduce all four knowledge transfer barriers investigated in the project groups. We found no significant difference in the nature of knowledge shared by teams with weak and strong ties. This suggests that teams with weak social ties who normally experience difficulty sharing complex (tacit) knowledge can easily do so with the aid of mobile facilities. In addition, frequent users of mobile phones were motivated to share explicit knowledge with their peers whilst those who often work with tacit knowledge could convert it to explicit form and share it with others. Mobile features like short messaging service and multimedia messaging service (SMS & MMS or what some people refer to as 'texting'), and email were mainly used to share knowledge and were perceived to reduce knowledge transfer time more than voice facilities. Our findings indicate that most students do not utilise the affordances of mobile phones for tacit knowledge transfer. Sharing of tacit knowledge needs to be encouraged since it allows individuals to achieve personal goals and may lead to effective management of oneself, other people and tasks. In addition, students do not appear to recognise the role of mobile phones in enhancing knowledge transfer. More awareness of this role needs to be created in institutions of learning in order to improve group learning and student performance.",20110301,"Kyobe, Michael E. ; Shongwe, Mzwandile M.",Article,Academic Journal,Mar2011,true,South African Journal of Information Management,Knowledge transfer ; Mobile communication systems ; Text messages ; Critical thinking ; Multimedia messaging ; Rating of students,JOUR,,,2078-1865,,,,,eng,African Online Scientific Information System PTY LTD,86,77,10,13,1,10.4102/sajim.v13i1.424,,RUN,,https://research.ebsco.com/linkprocessor/plink?id=bc3357c6-f9c8-3dd0-8471-7333f26a824e
"Library, Information Science & Technology Abstracts",lxh,62013955,Personal profiles: enhancing social interaction in learning networks.,"Nowadays, we can witness a surge of online profiling sites; in them people make their profile available to others with the intention to share it and get in touch with others, find old friends, classmates or colleagues, or look for new opportunities. Given their capacity to encourage members to be connected with other members and their growing popularity, we hold that some lessons can be learned from such profiling sites. In this paper's initial exploration, we analyse some of the most popular profiling sites to spot indications on profile composition and the affordances they use to encourage people to interact and to establish connections with other members. Based on this we discuss the importance of personal profiles depicting the characteristics and support mechanisms needed to enhance social interaction in learning networks.

Gender theorists call for more research into how and why women perform certain online activities, emphasizing the role of identity and the importance of context on perceptions and behavior. In order to examine the influence of gender in everyday online activities, this project examines women's perceptions of the internet within a specific context: looking for a job. It asks, how do perceptions of the internet influence women's techniques and strategies in navigating gender barriers and affordances in a job search? Interviews with 20 women looking for jobs online reveal that associations between gender and technologies and between gender and occupations can affect the job search process at various stages, including how and where people look for jobs, which jobs they apply to, and feelings of confidence and interest. Three characteristics of the internet emerged as central to women's strategies for navigating gender associations: (1) the volume and range of information online; (2) productivity and efficiency; and (3) anonymity. These characteristics are aspects of the ways in which the internet can both improve and limit women's online job searches.",20101201,"Martey, Rosa Mikeal",Article,Academic Journal,Dec2010,true,"Information, Communication & Society",Gender ; Technology ; Internet & society ; Man-woman relationships ; Communication & gender,JOUR,,,1369-118X,,,,,eng,Taylor & Francis Ltd,1229,1207,23,13,8,10.1080/13691181003663585,,5BA,,https://research.ebsco.com/linkprocessor/plink?id=0002bcd7-7276-3466-9eb6-209c43d7960b

The purpose of this paper is to show how users in one social Q&A community defy system constraints to engage in brief, informal episodes of collaborative information seeking called microcollaborations. A brief literature review is presented, suggesting a view of information seeking as a combination of problem-centered information seeking, technological affordances and constraints, and social and affective factors. The results of content and transaction log analyses of user interactions suggest that topics of collaboration share a common threshold of complexity and invite responses containing both fact and opinion.

"Library, Information Science & Technology Abstracts",lxh,53575375,Do your friends make you smarter?: An analysis of social strategies in online information seeking,"Abstract: Prior research in the social search space has focused on the informational benefits of collaborating with others during web and workplace information seeking. However, social interactions, especially during complex tasks, can have cognitive benefits as well. Our goal in this paper is to document the methods and outcomes of using social resources to help with exploratory search tasks. We used a talk-aloud protocol and video capture to explore the actions of eight subjects as they completed two “Google-hard” search tasks. Task questions were alternated between a Social and Non-Social Condition. The Social Condition restricted participants to use only social resources—search engines were not allowed. The Non-Social Condition permitted normal web-based information sources, but restricted the use of social tools. We describe the social tactics our participants used in their search process. Asking questions on social networking sites and targeting friends one-on-one both resulted in increased information processing but during different phases of the question–answering process. Participants received more responses via social networking sites but more thorough answers in private channels (one-on-one). We discuss the possibility that the technological and cultural affordances of different social–informational media may provide complementary cognitive benefits to searchers. Our work suggests that online social tools could be better integrated with each other and with existing search facilities. We conclude with a discussion of our findings and implications for the design of social search tools.",20101101,"Evans, Brynn M. ; Kairam, Sanjay ; Pirolli, Peter",Article,Academic Journal,Nov2010,true,Information Processing & Management,Web search engines ; Electronic information resource searching ; Information storage & retrieval systems ; Information processing ; Question answering systems ; Online social networks ; Social interaction ; Internet protocols,JOUR,,,0306-4573,,,,,eng,Elsevier B.V.,692,679,14,46,6,10.1016/j.ipm.2009.12.001,,INM,,https://research.ebsco.com/linkprocessor/plink?id=ba23e6cd-3af4-3771-a030-21de37d8306c

"Library, Information Science & Technology Abstracts",lxh,161278975,Political ideology and information technology in government online communication.,"Government agencies are directed to communicate objective and scientific information to the public, but studies show that political ideology may play a role in how much information governments provide. In this paper I argue that the ideology of a head administrator, and its alignment with agency mission, can restrict the kinds of information that government agencies provide, which may or may not amount to a type of regulatory capture. This impact may also be moderated by the specific media in which the communication takes place. I explore this theory via a case study of the United States Environmental Protection Agency online communication over a period of 32 months, during the years of 2013–2014, under the Democratic Administrator Gina McCarthy, and 2017–2018, under the Republican Administrator Scott Pruitt, via topical terms and document analyses of Twitter posts and web news releases. The information—topics, policies and issues—remain largely consistent across administrations and media channels, but notable distinctions are observed that point to the political ideologies of administrators in office, including a restriction of relevant scientific information on climate change during the misaligned administrator. Moreover, results show differences across media types which may reflect speed and popularity affordances of Twitter compared to website communication. I conclude by discussing the importance of policies to protect against ideological partisanship, and how social media may be better used as tools in government information policy and online communication. • Ideological alignment between administrator and agency mission helps explain variation in government information flows across ICTs. • Web news releases and Twitter posts are studied over 32 months and two distinct administrations of the US EPA. • Notable differences are observed in government information and communication across administrations and media • Ideological differences are found in quantity of terms used, and discourse surrounding certain topics, policies and issues",20230101,"DePaula, Nic",Article,Academic Journal,Jan2023,true,Government Information Quarterly,"Government information ; Internet in public administration ; Information technology ; United States.

"Library, Information Science & Technology Abstracts",lxh,47012088,SMS: EXPLOITING THE INTERACTIONAL CHARACTERISTICS OF NEAR-SYNCHRONY.,"This paper argues that near-synchrony creates interactional advantages for SMS and that these help to explain the popularity of the medium. The research included 32 interviews with adult mobile phone users, 24-hour communication diaries, and an analysis of respondents' text messages. Many of the text messages collected were short, phatic messages. These distinctive messages exploit the near-synchrony and brevity of SMS. Text messages combine low-contact threshold with immediate direct personal contact; consequently users can send 'thinking of you' messages, creating social connection with negligible effort and disruption. The near-synchrony of SMS also enables a distinctive form of conversation. In SMS conversation, the brevity of messages often creates ambiguity, but asynchrony limits scope for collaborative interpretation, making it harder to clarify meaning. However, instead of treating this as a problem for repair, users sometimes deliberately exploit this, using SMS as an equivocal, open-ended form of communication. The paper ends with a discussion of near-synchrony, contrasting SMS, email and instant messaging, and arguing that the temporal affordances of media are socially shaped and not technologically determined.",20091201,"Rettie, Ruth",Article,Academic Journal,Dec2009,true,"Information, Communication & Society",Text messages ; Instant messaging ; Email ; Cell phones ; Conversation,JOUR,,,1369-118X,,,,,eng,Taylor & Francis Ltd,1148,1131,18,12,8,10.1080/13691180902786943,,5BA,,https://research.ebsco.com/linkprocessor/plink?id=8f570301-a71b-393e-a7dc-74a38bb9b5a4

"Library, Information Science & Technology Abstracts",lxh,44698540,Turn to the material: Remote diagnostics systems and new forms of boundary-spanning,"Abstract: To learn and adapt, organizations engage widely in Information Technology (IT)-mediated boundary-spanning. This involves making sense of a swath of peripheral information made available by digital means so as to expand local knowledge. Prior research on boundary-spanning has paid scant attention to material differences between IT systems in enabling or constraining such activity. In this article, we argue that material features do matter: features afforded by IT systems have a significant impact on the form and content of boundary-spanning. We analyze material features and related affordances provided by remote diagnostics systems – a family of ubiquitous IT systems. These features allow remote diagnostics systems to collect, store, and continuously analyze data about the state of machinery and related production processes across space, time and organizational boundaries. Organizations use these systems to determine when maintenance intervention is needed, or to improve their production processes. Often, these systems are run by external service providers at remote sites, which become the new ears and the eyes of a focal organization’s production processes. Building on a longitudinal multi-site case study of two organizations, we explore the impacts of remote diagnostics systems on boundary-spanning. We observe that material features afforded by the remote diagnostics led the organizations to change their boundary-spanning in contradictory ways. On one hand, they reinforced existing boundaries. On the other hand, they crossed or cut down others, or created new ones. This suggests that the material features of these systems, when combined with new knowledge creation and sharing practices, within and between the local and the remote sites generate richer, multi-faceted inter-organizational knowledge flows. We surmise that IT’s new material features will continue to significantly shape organizing logics that determine where and when organizational boundaries are drawn and crossed. Future boundary-spanning will increasingly be shaped by socio-technical assemblages brought together by increasingly pervasive IT capabilities.",20091001,"Jonsson, Katrin ; Holmström, Jonny ; Lyytinen, Kalle",Article,Academic Journal,Oct2009,true,Information & Organization,Information technology ; Computer peripherals ; Diagnostic services ; Business enterprises ; Local knowledge ; Constraint satisfaction ; Manufacturing processes,JOUR,,,1471-7727,,,,,eng,Elsevier B.V.,252,233,20,19,4,10.1016/j.infoandorg.2009.07.001,,JG1,,https://research.ebsco.com/linkprocessor/plink?id=821526d9-416b-3a60-b197-0e55c4e05a1c

Yet apart from physical meetings, 'alter-globalization' activists also meet in a variety of online spaces. This article investigates the role of such spaces in the communicative process of collective identity construction by examining three email lists devoted to the organizing of the London 2004 ESF - a European list, a national and a national-factional. Considering collective identity formation as a communicative process, the article has focused on the design of the selected lists and the social context or 'we' that each one helped constitute. It also explored the communicative affordances of the lists for the process of collective identity formation by looking at bonding, trust-building and interactivity. The results show that depending on their purpose, accessibility and geographical scale, the email lists served as distinct but overlapping loci of collective identity. These settings displayed varying degrees of breadth and heterogeneity in terms of their themes and focus, their types of author, as well as the language in which messages were written. They also exhibited different degrees of interactivity with the factional list helping the formation of a cohesive collective identity for its members, while the European one allowed the emergence of a much looser, open and fragmented sense of the collective.",20090901,"Kavada, Anastasia",Article,Academic Journal,Sep2009,true,"Information, Communication & Society",Email ; Email systems ; Computer software industry ; Computer networks ; Forums,JOUR,,,1369-118X,,,,,eng,Taylor & Francis Ltd,839,817,23,12,6,10.1080/13691180802304854,,5BA,,https://research.ebsco.com/linkprocessor/plink?id=97f47661-acee-3b08-bda5-1c751b75800d

Whereas the literature on political activism has generally argued that the Internet provides low-cost communication that facilitates collective action, this case highlights the labors that accompany Internet-assisted activism. The analysis, based upon participant-observation, identifies three interrelated problems with which the activists struggled: overcommunication, miscommunication, and communicative overload. Drawing on concepts taken from science and technology studies, the article argues that these problems have sociotechnical roots and arise from the specific affordances of an increasing number of Internet elements. Such elements reduce the up-front costs associated with communication for the sender, but they generate new transaction costs when integrated into heterogeneous assemblages with no shared communication protocol, no clear infrastructure or exostructure, and no significant means of tempering the tendency towards ever greater amounts of communication.",20090701,"Nielsen, Rasmus Kleis",Article,Academic Journal,2009,true,Journal of Information Technology & Politics,United States ; Internet & politics ; Activism ; Political participation ; Volunteer service ; Primaries,JOUR,,,1933-1681,,,,,eng,Taylor & Francis Ltd,280,267,14,6,3/4,10.1080/19331680903048840,,3AFS,,https://research.ebsco.com/linkprocessor/plink?id=73986b49-1187-34cc-b0f3-92eb82931ecd

Although it is theoretically possible for a VW platform to support all types of activities, designers make choices that lead technologies to be more or less suited for different learning objectives. Virtual World platforms' capabilities can be characterized in terms of the extent to which they are multiple or special purpose and the degree to which they support incorporation of few or many knowledge resources. Matching these capabilities with a framework for characterizing instructional approach and learning objectives provides a basis for selecting, piloting, and advocating use of particular VW platforms in specific educational contexts.",20090601,"Robbins, Russell W. ; Butler, Brian S.",Article,Academic Journal,Summer2009,true,Journal of Information Systems Education,Taxonomy ; Electronic information resources ; Computer systems ; Educational technology ; Virtual reality ; Business education ; Simulation methods in education ; Virtual reality in education ; Shared virtual environments ; Instructional systems ; Learning communities ; Microteaching,JOUR,,,1055-3096,,,,,eng,Information Systems & Computing Academic Professionals (ISCAP),210,199,12,20,2,,,E18,,https://research.ebsco.com/linkprocessor/plink?id=d152756e-a46a-371b-ab3b-11e05db8470a
"Library, Information Science & Technology Abstracts",lxh,34506257,Community and social network sites as Technology Enhanced Learning Environments.,"This paper examines the affordance of the Danish social networking site Mingler.dk for peer-to-peer learning and development. With inspiration from different theoretical frameworks, the authors argue how learning and development in such social online systems can be conceptualised and analysed. Theoretically the paper defines development in accordance with Vygotsky's concept of the zone of proximal development, and learning in accordance with Wenger's concept of communities of practice. The authors suggest analysing the learning and development taking place on Mingler.dk by using these concepts supplemented by the notion of horizontal learning adopted from Engestrom and Wenger. Their analysis shows how horizontal learning happens by crossing boundaries between several sites of engagement, and how the actors' multiple membership enables the community members to draw on a vast amount of resources from a multiplicity of sites. They show how the members thereby also become (co)producers of such resources, which then in turn become resources for other communities.",20081001,"Ryberg, Thomas ; Christiansen, Ellen",Article,Academic Journal,Oct2008,true,"Technology, Pedagogy & Education",Websites ; Internet in education ; Curriculum ; Online education ; Learning ; Educational technology ; Denmark ; Social networks ; Curriculum frameworks ; Educational innovations,JOUR,,,1475-939X,,,,,eng,Taylor & Francis Ltd,219,207,13,17,3,10.1080/14759390802383801,,131K,,https://research.ebsco.com/linkprocessor/plink?id=93a1495c-f795-3873-9a29-bb16841f9cc7

It suggests that the digital library can contribute to student empowerment in information literacy practices while searching, using and collaboratively building the digital library resources. To illustrate this, the authors have been experimenting with the implementation of an integrated information literacy model based on Eisenberg and Berkowitz' Big 6 Model and describes the CDL features in association with the information literacy dimensions in this model. The CDL focuses on the project-based learning approach to conduct students' project, which supports specific information behaviors that underpin research and learning such as information seeking, browsing, encountering, foraging, sharing, gathering, filtering, and using. Findings regarding teachers' reception of the digital library are encouraging as they feel the relevance of the digital library to the current requirement of the students' project and its potential to entrench information and resource study skills through project-based learning.",20080901,"Abdullah, Abrizah ; Zainab, A.

"Library, Information Science & Technology Abstracts",lxh,28842138,PapierCraft: A Gesture-Based Command System for Interactive Paper.,"Paper persists as an integral component of active reading and other knowledge-worker tasks because it provides ease of use unmatched by digital alternatives. Paper documents are light to carry, easy to annotate, rapid to navigate, flexible to manipulate, and robust to use in varied environments. Interactions with paper documents create rich webs of annotation, cross reference, and spatial organization. Unfortunately, the resulting webs are confined to the physical world of paper and, as they accumulate, become increasingly difficult to store, search, and access. XLibris [Schilit et al. 1998] and similar systems address these difficulties by simulating paper with tablet PCs. While this approach is promising, it suffers not only from limitations of current tablet computers (e.g., limited screen space) but also from loss of invaluable paper affordances. In this article, we describe PapierCraft, a gesture-based command system that allows users to manipulate digital documents using paper printouts as proxies. Using an Anoto [Anoto 20021 digital pen, users can draw command gestures on paper to tag a paragraph, e-mail a selected area, copy selections to a notepad, or create links to related documents. Upon pen synchronization, PapierCraft executes the commands and presents the results in a digital document viewer. Users can then search the tagged information and navigate the web of annotated digital documents resulting from interactions with the paper proxies. PapierCraft also supports real time interactions across mix-media, for example, letting users copy information from paper to a Tablet PC screen. This article presents the design and implementation of the PapierCraft system and describes user feedback from initial use.",20071201,"Chunyuan Liao ; Guimbretière, François ; Hinckley, Ken ; Hollan, Jim",Article,Academic Journal,Dec2007,true,ACM Transactions on Computer-Human Interaction (TOCHI),Records management ; Electronic records ; Human-computer interaction ; Interactive computer systems ; Optical properties of paper ; Printing properties of paper ; User-centered system design,JOUR,,,1073-0516,,,,,eng,Association for Computing Machinery,27,1,27,14,4,,,88E,,https://research.ebsco.com/linkprocessor/plink?id=4a640ed4-f6e4-34bf-b325-e52496ccbe24

A key technique in the authors' methodology has been the use of video-stimulated reflective dialogue to assist teachers to reflect on key episodes in their teaching. In this paper the authors discuss how this technique was extended to encourage pupils to reflect on their learning. Children in parallel classes with and without interactive whiteboards were interviewed in a range of subject areas between the ages of 5 and 14. Analysis of reflective dialogues indicates that even very young children were able to articulate opinions about the ways in which ICT supported their learning. Pupils were able to talk more explicitly about the impact of ICT on their learning processes in classes that had a focus on thinking skills and learning to learn. The role of ICT in supporting learning was viewed in a variety of ways by pupils. Many of these were common across ages and contexts, but others were critically dependent on the classroom culture and the nature of the dominant style of classroom discourse. A wider range of affordances of ICT was exploited in classes in which the dominant discourse was dialogical.",20071001,"Tanner, Howard ; Jones, Sonia",Article,Academic Journal,Oct2007,true,"Technology, Pedagogy & Education",Interactive computer systems ; Communication & technology ; Research methodology ; Data analysis ; Educational technology ; Education ; Teaching aids ; Instructional systems ; Discourse analysis,JOUR,,,1475-939X,,,,,eng,Taylor & Francis Ltd,335,321,15,16,3,10.1080/14759390701614454,,131K,,https://research.ebsco.com/linkprocessor/plink?id=4ed8ef91-0289-33f6-9233-8a72c679b3aa
"Library, Information Science & Technology Abstracts",lxh,27216637,Media use in long-distance friendships.,"New media such as email and mobile phones have made it easier to maintain relationships over distances. The present paper examines which media people use to maintain long-distance friendships. The main focus lies on the comparison of email and phone. Media choice theories like media richness theory assume that media can be classified according to their richness, and that people choose the medium which fits best to the affordances of a specific task. The phone as richer medium should be preferred over email in the case of maintenance of long-distance friendships because it is easier to express emotions and to give immediate feedback via phone than via email. Email is an asynchronous medium and communication via email is therefore independent of space and time. Therefore, it can also be argued that email is preferred over the phone because it makes it easier to communicate across different work schedules or even time-zones. In two studies (Study 1 conducted in the Netherlands, Study 2 conducted in Germany) media use in long-distance friendships was measured. Across both studies, email was the most frequently used medium. In Study 1, an interesting asymmetric influence of closeness of the friendship emerged. The closer the friendship, the more emails were written in total, but the less the relative use of email. Instead, the percentage of phone calls increased. Study 2 aimed to replicate and explain this finding and assessed also the content of the phone call or emails. Whereas the intimateness of the emails did not change with increased closeness of the friendship, the intimateness of the phone calls increased with increasing closeness of the friendship. This result indicates that people use email primarily for staying in touch, whereas important personal matters are still discussed on the phone.",20071001,"Utz, Sonja",Article,Academic Journal,Oct2007,true,"Information, Communication & Society",Mass media ; Communication ; Telematics ; Email ; Friendship ; Long-distance relationships ; Interpersonal relations ; Telephones,JOUR,,,1369-118X,,,,,eng,Taylor & Francis Ltd,713,694,20,10,5,10.1080/13691180701658046,,5BA,,https://research.ebsco.com/linkprocessor/plink?id=c750b547-acbf-3138-a623-10a3e016a2f2

Social media platforms can provide LGBTQ youths with a space that counters heteronormative environments and potentially supports mental health and well-being. Mental health includes an individual's state of psychological and emotional well-being and not merely the absence of mental disorders.<bold>Objective: </bold>We sought to identify how LGBTQ youths and adolescents use social media for connection with other LGBTQ peers and groups, identity development, and social support and how these affect mental health and well-being.<bold>Methods: </bold>PRISMA (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses) procedures were used to guide this review. Searches were conducted in ACM Digital Library, CINAHL, Ovid Embase, Ovid MEDLINE, and Web of Science in March 2021. This review focused on LGBTQ youths aged 10 to 24 years. Included peer-reviewed studies must comprise social media; explore peer connection, identity development, or social support; and be published from 2012 onward. In total, 2 researchers extracted data and performed quality assessments independently using the Newcastle-Ottawa Scale for quantitative articles and the Critical Appraisal Skills Programme for qualitative articles. Qualitative synthesis was performed on articles that satisfied the eligibility criteria.<bold>Results: </bold>A total of 26 studies (n=15, 58% qualitative; n=8, 31% quantitative; n=3, 12% mixed methods) met the inclusion criteria. Of the 8 quantitative studies, 6 (75%) were cross-sectional, and 2 (25%) were cohort studies. All studies ranged from moderate to high quality. Social media was a popular tool used by LGBTQ youths to connect with LGBTQ communities. In qualitative data, we found that LGBTQ youths negotiated and explored identity and obtained support from peers on social media. Instagram, Tumblr, and Twitter were commonly used to access LGBTQ content owing to ease of anonymity. Identity management was the most studied social media affordance, important to LGBTQ youths for strategic disclosure. Key strategies for managing identities included being anonymous, censoring locations or content, restricting audiences, and using multiple accounts. Quantitative studies (3/8, 38%) showed that social media was associated with reduced mental health concerns and increased well-being among LGBTQ youths. Mental health concerns arising from social media use were attributed to discrimination, victimization, and policies that did not accommodate changed identities.<bold>Conclusions: </bold>We found that social media may support the mental health and well-being of LGBTQ youths through peer connection, identity management, and social support, but findings were limited by weaknesses in the evidence. More robust and longitudinal studies are needed to determine the relationship between social media use and LGBTQ mental health, particularly among adolescents. The findings may inform interventions to promote social media health literacy and the mental health and well-being of this vulnerable group.<bold>Trial Registration: </bold>PROSPERO CRD42020222535; https://www.crd.york.ac.uk/prospero/display_record.php?RecordID=222535.",20220901,"Berger, Matthew N ; Taba, Melody ; Marino, Jennifer L ; Lim, Megan S C ; Skinner, S Rachel",Article,Academic Journal,Sep2022,true,Journal of Medical Internet Research,Social media ; Human sexuality ; Gender identity,JOUR,,,1439-4456,,,,,eng,JMIR Publications Inc.,N.PAG,N.PAG,,24,9,10.2196/38449,,DNC,,https://research.ebsco.com/linkprocessor/plink?id=b21657e6-e41f-3aa8-a8ca-b22db7d0e652

"Library, Information Science & Technology Abstracts",lxh,3974102,A situated cognition view about the effects of planning and authorship on computer program debugging.,"Two experiments were conducted to investigate the relationship between planning and debugging and the effect of program authorship on debugging strategies. Three groups of participants with different programming experiences were recruited. In the first experiment, the participants were asked to develop and debug their self-generated program whereas in the second experiment, they were asked to debug an otherwritten program where some logical errors were planted. Situated cognition approach, being an emergent cognitive paradigm, furnishes an alternative framework to understand the problems of interest. Deweyan notion of inquiry and Gibsonian theory of affordance are of particular relevance. The results show that planning is ineffective for debugging, irrespective of the programming expertise level and program authorship. Besides, situated debugging is demonstrated to be the preferred strategy which is not significantly related to the program authorship. A model of planning for program debugging and a theory of two-faceted transparency are postulated for explicating the observations.",19981101,"Law, Lai-Chong",Article,Academic Journal,Nov98,true,Behaviour & Information Technology,Computer programmers ; Debugging ; Attitude (Psychology),JOUR,,,0144-929X,,,,,eng,Taylor & Francis Ltd,337,325,13,17,6,10.1080/014492998119283,,B6Q,,https://research.ebsco.com/linkprocessor/plink?id=ccfce4ef-7742-3465-a9e8-636ed0e91840

The rapid growth of the internet has empowered older adults to access web-based health information sources. However, research explicitly exploring older adults' online health information seeking (OHIS) behavior is still underway.<bold>Objective: </bold>This systematic scoping review aims to understand older adults' OHIS and answer four research questions: (1) What types of health information do older adults seek and where do they seek health information on the internet? (2) What are the factors that influence older adults' OHIS? (3) What are the barriers to older adults' OHIS? (4) How can we intervene and support older adults' OHIS?<bold>Methods: </bold>A comprehensive literature search was performed in November 2020, involving the following academic databases: Web of Science; Cochrane Library database; PubMed; MEDLINE; CINAHL Plus; APA PsycINFO; Library and Information Science Source; Library, Information Science and Technology Abstracts; Psychology and Behavioral Sciences Collection; Communication & Mass Media Complete; ABI/INFORM; and ACM Digital Library. The initial search identified 8047 publications through database search strategies. After the removal of duplicates, a data set consisting of 5949 publications was obtained for screening. Among these, 75 articles met the inclusion criteria. Qualitative content analysis was performed to identify themes related to the research questions.<bold>Results: </bold>The results suggest that older adults seek 10 types of health information from 6 types of internet-based information sources and that 2 main categories of influencing factors, individual-related and source-related, impact older adults' OHIS. Moreover, the results reveal that in their OHIS, older adults confront 3 types of barriers, namely individual, social, and those related to information and communication technologies. Some intervention programs based on educational training workshops have been created to intervene and support older adults' OHIS.<bold>Conclusions: </bold>Although OHIS has become increasingly common among older adults, the review reveals that older adults' OHIS behavior is not adequately investigated. The findings suggest that more studies are needed to understand older adults' OHIS behaviors and better support their medical and health decisions in OHIS. Based on the results, the review proposes multiple objectives for future studies, including (1) more investigations on the OHIS behavior of older adults above 85 years; (2) conducting more longitudinal, action research, and mixed methods studies; (3) elaboration of the mobile context and cross-platform scenario of older adults' OHIS; (4) facilitating older adults' OHIS by explicating technology affordance; and (5) promoting and measuring the performance of OHIS interventions for older adults.",20220201,"Zhao, Yuxiang Chris ; Zhao, Mengyuan ; Song, Shijie",journal article,Academic Journal,Feb2022,true,Journal of Medical Internet Research,Information-seeking behavior ; Database searching ; Information & communication technologies ; Web databases ; Older people ; Systematic reviews ; Medical care research ; Health behavior,JOUR,,,1439-4456,,,,,eng,JMIR Publications Inc.,N.PAG,N.PAG,,24,2,10.2196/34790,,DNC,,https://research.ebsco.com/linkprocessor/plink?id=57d14e66-5c02-3a48-99fc-45ea2337870e
"Library, Information Science & Technology Abstracts",lxh,154559924,Unpacking the digitalisation of public services: Configuring work during automation in local government.,"The digitalisation of public services involves not only the transformation of the relationship between public service providers and clients, but also the transformation of public administration work. While most studies of digitalisation of the public sector have focused on the practical outcomes for the quality of public services and the quality of public administration work, none have unpacked , or theorised, how these changes actually come about in practice. This paper fills this gap by drawing on a study of the in-house adaptation of a digital automation tool (an RPA) by a Swedish local authority. In the article, we pay attention to what we, inspired by Donna Haraway and Lucy Suchman, call 'configuring work', i.e. the weaving together of the affordances of the technology, materials, discourses, roles and power structures. The contribution of the paper is two-fold. First, the paper demonstrates empirically how the digitalisation of a public service took place through an emergent, relational process that involved both the social and the material. Second, by adopting the the idea of 'configuring work' and paying attention to the effects of this, we show that the digitalisation process was successively shaped by the particular vested interests, ethics, discourses and the algorithmic materialities that comprised it. This helps us discuss the reason for why, in extant literature, digitalisation threatens the professional autonomy of the public administrators as well as why it may reduce service quality. Finally, we suggest how some of these issues may be addressed in future research. • The paper demonstrates how digitalisation at the micro-level take place through configuring work • Configuring work is shaped by the particular materiality, vested interests, ethics and discourses that comprise it • Even though the staff was involved in the digitalisation process, the logic of the technology imposes itself on the results",20220101,"Andersson, Christoffer ; Hallin, Anette ; Ivory, Chris",Article,Academic Journal,Jan2022,true,Government Information Quarterly,"Automation ; Municipal services ; Local government ; Public administration ; Public sector ; Haraway, Donna Jeanne 1944-",JOUR,,,0740-624X,,,,,eng,Elsevier B.V.,N.PAG,N.PAG,,39,1,10.1016/j.giq.2021.101662,,GIQ,,https://research.ebsco.com/linkprocessor/plink?id=50de775d-30b5-36da-a7a0-0bc727ec7d95

Organic products may have several health benefits for consumers. Nevertheless, even in the age of social commerce, and the communication affordances of social networking sites, consumers are not always informed regarding such benefits. As such, we examine how the characteristics of social commerce and organic foods can work in tandem to influence organic products purchase intentions. We develop a model based on the theory of consumption values and test it empirically. The results show that interactivity, recommendations, and feedback are important social commerce characteristics (affordances), while food safety and eco-friendliness are key organic food characteristics. Such social commerce and organic food characteristics interact and serve as inputs for functional value and emotional value assessments, which in turn, drive purchase intentions of organic foods via social commerce. The findings also show that functional value is more instrumental in this process; and that there is also a significant difference between males and females in the formation of purchase intention.

"Library, Information Science & Technology Abstracts",lxh,139977808,"Snapping, pinning, liking or texting: Investigating social media in higher education beyond Facebook.","Commercial social media are being increasingly adopted in formal learning settings even though they have not been conceived specifically for education. Whereas highly popular social services like Facebook and Twitter have been thoroughly investigated for their benefits for teaching and learning in higher education, other social media platforms which have been gaining considerable attention among youth have been largely overlooked in scholarly literature. The purpose of this study is to fill that vacuum by analyzing whether and how social media platforms like Instagram, Pinterest, Snapchat and WhatsApp have become an integral component of teaching and learning in higher education. A total of 46 studies are analyzed in terms of what pedagogical affordances of these four platforms they identify (e.g., mixing information and learning resources, hybridization of expertise, widening of the context of learning) and the benefits for learning that the authors go on to investigate. Results show that although the use of WhatsApp is well documented in a plethora of studies, there is a dearth of research about Instagram, Pinterest and Snapchat. While more than half of the studies are carried out in the Middle East and Asian areas and investigate mostly benefits for second and foreign language learning, the overall geographical distribution of studies examining learning via social media reflects the preferences expressed for these services on the part of the general population. Moreover, it is found that the pedagogical affordances of social media are still only being partially implemented and that diverse social media exploit affordances to different degrees. • Social media research continues to increase and attract growing scholarly interest • Prevalence of the number of WhatsApp studies over the other three services considered • Pinterest and Instagram studies still attract mild scholarly interest • Snapchat is the least investigated of the services considered • Geographical distribution reflects the preferences expressed by the general population in regard to single platforms",20200101,"Manca, Stefania",Article,Academic Journal,Jan2020,true,Internet & Higher Education,Social media ; Information resources ; Middle East ; Social media in education ; Second language acquisition ; Personal identification numbers ; Social learning ; Social science research,JOUR,,,1096-7516,,,,,eng,Elsevier B.V.,N.PAG,N.PAG,,44,,10.1016/j.iheduc.2019.100707,,5CO,,https://research.ebsco.com/linkprocessor/plink?id=ce943a79-1e17-3046-b586-fe5d8bdd9852
"Library, Information Science & Technology Abstracts",lxh,141170186,Using microblog to enhance public service climate in the rural areas.,"Public service availability and quality remain relatively low in the rural areas, particularly in developing countries. Microblog has been employed in the rural areas to enhance public services. We propose that by facilitating collaboration among public employees and enabling supervision of their services, microblog can help enhance the public service climate and improve public service performance in the rural areas. A research model is developed to evaluate the importance of microblog affordance and public service capabilities based on the service climate theory. Through surveying the grassroots public employees in 382 villages, we find that the collaboration and supervision affordances of microblog are important in leading to better public service climate. While the collaboration affordance of microblog has both direct and indirect effects, its supervision affordance effect is indirect through enhancing the content delivery and service fulfillment capacities. Furthermore, our additional analysis shows that public service climate can raise the service satisfaction of the rural citizens. The findings show that microblog adoption enhances public service climate in the rural areas where less attention is given. A set of important recommendations are provided to public administrators on how they can more effectively leverage on the emerging microblog technology in the rural context. • Microblog's collaboration and supervision affordances can lead to better public service climate in rural areas. • Content delivery and service fulfillment intermediate the relation between microblog's affordances and public service climate • The collaboration affordance of microblog has both direct and indirect effects",20200101,"Yang, Yang ; Liu, Yuan ; Phang, Chee Wei ; Wei, June",Article,Academic Journal,Jan2020,true,Government Information Quarterly,Microblogs ; Municipal services ; Rural geography ; Supervision of employees ; Climatology ; Quality of service,JOUR,,,0740-624X,,,,,eng,Elsevier B.V.,N.PAG,N.PAG,,37,1,10.1016/j.giq.2019.101402,,GIQ,,https://research.ebsco.com/linkprocessor/plink?id=df96f06f-8fa7-3b11-8a97-9486db676b60

"Library, Information Science & Technology Abstracts",lxh,152742247,A Review on Clustering Techniques: Creating Better User Experience for Online Roadshow.,"Online roadshow is a relatively new concept that has higher flexibility and scalability compared to the physical roadshow. This is because online roadshow is accessible through digital devices anywhere and anytime. In a physical roadshow, organizations can measure the effectiveness of the roadshow by interacting with the customers. However, organizations cannot monitor the effectiveness of the online roadshow by using the same method. A good user experience is important to increase the advertising effects on the online roadshow website. In web usage mining, clustering can discover user access patterns from the weblog. By applying a clustering technique, the online roadshow website can be further improved to provide a better user experience. This paper presents a review of clustering techniques used in web usage mining, namely the partition-based, hierarchical, density-based, and fuzzy clustering techniques. These clustering techniques are analyzed from three perspectives: their similarity measures, the evaluation metrics used to determine the optimality of the clusters, and the functional purpose of applying the techniques to improve the user experience of the website. By applying clustering techniques in different stages of the user activities in the online roadshow website, the advertising effectiveness of the website can be enhanced in terms of its affordance, flow, and interactivity.",20210901,"Lim, Zhou-Yi ; Ong, Lee-Yeng ; Leow, Meng-Chew",Article,Academic Journal,Sep2021,true,Future Internet,Web analytics ; User experience ; Fuzzy clustering technique ; Advertising effectiveness ; Tourism websites,JOUR,,,1999-5903,,,,,eng,MDPI,,233,,13,9,10.3390/fi13090233,,B74E,,https://research.ebsco.com/linkprocessor/plink?id=0100c03c-dc3e-32b4-86c7-7331be8b1ff8

Even so, the phenomenon has been little historicised. This paper engages in a deconstructionist exercise on historical references in digital activism literature towards exploring implicit meaning-making in a symbolic-interactionist tradition. It identifies four distinct narratives: 1) a technology narrative [activism as technology-driven]; 2) a communications narrative [activism on the basis of communication options]; 3) an online-off-line narrative [activism based on an online-off-line dichotomy]; and 4) an engagement narrative [activism based on its affordances for public engagement]. The paper argues that these narratives contribute to a distinct, polysemic, and paradoxical understanding of digital activism as a phenomenon that is technologically driven (technological determinism), and both distinct to and enmeshed with traditional activism. In doing so, this narrative analysis shows a range of underlying ideological assumptions in digital activism study and conceptualisation, which informs how the phenomenon is understood today.",20210801,"Özkula, Suay Melisa",Article,Academic Journal,Aug2021,true,First Monday,Digital media ; Hypertext literature ; Activism ; Digital storytelling ; Narratives,JOUR,,,1396-0466,,,,,eng,First Monday,1,1,1,26,8,10.5210/fm.v26i8.10597,,DZZ,,https://research.ebsco.com/linkprocessor/plink?id=51272aec-52f7-31bd-a58e-c4dd004cfcaa

Founded in September 2018 by a group of Asian-Australian teenagers 'as a joke', SAT members share 'Asian positive' stories, resources, and memes through an average of 1,200 new posts daily. Alongside global milestone events, such as the rise of K-pop in the Global North and Korean film Parasite's unprecedented four awards at the Academy Awards, SAT has also evolved into a space to celebrate Asian excellence, tease out identity politics, and discuss issues of injustice. However, upon the onset of COVID-19, the posts on SAT have swiftly pivoted to the everyday lived experiences of (diaspora) East Asians around the world. In this paper, we reflect on our experiences as East Asian diaspora members on SAT, and share our observations of meaning-making, identity-making, and community-making as East Asians who are collectively coping with our cultural identities and with COVID-19 aggression.

The study involved 94 participants, who were asked to write a product review on their recently bought cell phones. The level of cognitive dissonance was measured by a self-report scale. The product reviews were analyzed by the Narrative Categorical Content Analytical Toolkit. The analysis revealed that agency, spatio-temporal perspective, and psychological perspective reflected the level of cognitive dissonance of the reviewers. The results are interpreted by elaborating on the idea that narratives have affordance to express affect.",20210101,"Pólya, Tibor ; Kengyel, Gabriella Judith ; Budai, Tímea",Article,Academic Journal,Jan2021,true,Information,Social media ; Cognitive dissonance ; Product reviews ; Construction ; Narratives,JOUR,,,2078-2489,,,,,eng,MDPI,46,46,1,12,1,10.3390/info12010046,,B74H,,https://research.ebsco.com/linkprocessor/plink?id=94026307-bf34-3e53-aa55-b16df4a5a634

Few studies have directed attention specifically to how women are using these technologies from the diverse array available to them. Even fewer have focused on Australian women's use of digital health.<bold>Objective: </bold>The Australian Women and Digital Health Project aimed to investigate which types of digital technologies women used regularly for health-related purposes and which they found most helpful and useful. Qualitative methods-semistructured interviews and focus groups-were employed to shed light on the situated complexities of the participants' enactments of digital health technologies. The project adopted a feminist new materialism theoretical perspective, focusing on the affordances, relational connections, and affective forces that came together to open up or close off the agential capacities generated with and through these enactments.<bold>Methods: </bold>The project comprised two separate studies including a total of 66 women. In study 1, 36 women living in the city of Canberra took part in face-to-face interviews and focus groups, while study 2 involved telephone interviews with 30 women from other areas of Australia.<bold>Results: </bold>The affordances of search engines to locate health information and websites and social media platforms for providing information and peer support were highly used and valued. Affective forces such as the desire for trust, motivation, empowerment, reassurance, control, care, and connection emerged in the participants' accounts. Agential capacities generated with and through digital health technologies included the capacity to seek and generate information and create a better sense of knowledge and expertise about bodies, illness, and health care, including the women's own bodies and health, that of their families and friends, and that of their often anonymous online social networks. The participants referred time and again to appreciating the feelings of agency and control that using digital health technologies afforded them. When the technologies failed to work as expected, these agential capacities were not realized. Women responded with feelings of frustration, disappointment, and annoyance, leading them to become disenchanted with the possibilities of the digital technologies they had tried.<bold>Conclusions: </bold>The findings demonstrate the nuanced and complex ways in which the participants were engaging with and contributing to online sources of information and using these sources together with face-to-face encounters with doctors and other health care professionals and friends and family members. They highlight the lay forms of expertise that the women had developed in finding, assessing, and creating health knowledges. The study also emphasized the key role that many women play in providing advice and health care for family members not only as digitally engaged patients but also as digitally engaged carers.",20190101,"Lupton, Deborah ; Maslen, Sarah",journal article,Academic Journal,Jan2019,true,Journal of Medical Internet Research,Digital technology ; Social media ; Websites ; Women's health ; Health information technology,JOUR,,,1439-4456,,,,,eng,JMIR Publications Inc.,19,19,1,21,1,10.2196/11481,,DNC,,https://research.ebsco.com/linkprocessor/plink?id=4fa23597-1500-3f26-9122-4042f815c0c5

Given the complex and mixed accounts of the results, questions have been raised on how large-scale digitalization programs are governed to reach health policy goals of quality improvement and equal access along with necessary digital transformations. In this qualitative systematic review, we investigate the following question: How is governance implemented and considered in the studies included in the qualitative review?<bold>Objective: </bold>The aim of this study is to arrive at informed and recognizable conceptualizations and considerations of models of governance connected to eHealth, as presented and discussed in the scientific literature. In turn, we hope our results will help inform the discussion of how to govern such processes to obtain collectively negotiated objectives.<bold>Methods: </bold>A qualitative systematic review is a method for integrating or comparing with the findings from qualitative studies. It looks for ""themes"" or ""constructs"" that lie in or across individual qualitative studies. This type of review produces a narrative synthesis with thematic analysis and includes interpretive conceptual models. The goal is an interpretation and broadens the understanding of a particular phenomenon. We searched the PubMed database using predefined search terms and selected papers published from 2010 onwards. We specified the criteria for selection and quality assessment.<bold>Results: </bold>The search returned 220 papers. We selected 44 abstracts for full-text reading, and 11 papers were included for full-text synthesis. On the basis of the 11 papers, we constructed four governance models to categorize and conceptualize the findings. The models are political governance, normally depicting top-down processes; medical governance, which normally depicts bottom-up processes; the internet and global model, emphasizing international business strategies coupled with the internet; self-governance, which builds upon the development of the internet and Internet of Things, which has paved the way for personal governance and communication of one's own health data.<bold>Conclusions: </bold>Collective negotiations between the nation-state and global policy actors, medical and self-governance actors, and global business and industry actors are essential.

Using work created through the University of Idaho's Think Open Fellows 2019–20 Cohort as a starting point, the author explores how these projects created OER content that demonstrates Lambert's three principles of OER and social justice. The author discusses the unique potentials of the academic library to support intentionally engaged OER as well as the responsibility of librarians to center marginalized perspectives in their work with faculty as cocreators and identifiers of OER. A discussion of some of the transformative aspects of this work follows, including the potential impacts on librarians with marginalized identities in creating intentionally engaged OER, as briefly examined through bell hooks's notion of engaged pedagogy.

Compared with face-to-face treatment, the use of digital interventions may be more cost-effective, appealing, and accessible, but there has been inadequate attention to their use with younger populations (children aged 5-12 years).<bold>Objective: </bold>This systematic review aims to (1) identify effective digital interventions, (2) report the characteristics of promising interventions, and (3) describe the user's experience of the digital intervention.<bold>Methods: </bold>A total of 4 databases were searched (Excerpta Medica Database [EMBASE], PsycINFO, Medical Literature Analysis and Retrieval System Online [MEDLINE], and the Cochrane Library) between January 2014 and January 2019. The inclusion criteria for studies were as follows: (1) children aged between 5 and 12 years, (2) interventions for behavior change, (3) randomized controlled trials, (4) digital interventions, and (5) chronic health conditions. Two researchers independently double reviewed papers to assess eligibility, extract data, and assess quality.<bold>Results: </bold>Searches run in the databases identified 2643 papers. We identified 17 eligible interventions. The most promising interventions (having a beneficial effect and low risk of bias) were 3 targeting overweight or obesity, using exergaming or social media, and 2 for anxiety, using web-based cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT). Characteristics of promising interventions included gaming features, therapist support, and parental involvement. Most were purely behavioral interventions (rather than CBT or third wave), typically using the behavior change techniques (BCTs) feedback and monitoring, shaping knowledge, repetition and substitution, and reward. Three papers included qualitative data on the user's experience. We developed the following themes: parental involvement, connection with a health professional is important for engagement, technological affordances and barriers, and child-centered design.<bold>Conclusions: </bold>Of the 17 eligible interventions, digital interventions for anxiety and overweight or obesity had the greatest promise. Using qualitative methods during digital intervention development and evaluation may lead to more meaningful, usable, feasible, and engaging interventions, especially for this underresearched younger population. The following characteristics could be considered when developing digital interventions for younger children: involvement of parents, gaming features, additional therapist support, behavioral (rather than cognitive) approaches, and particular BCTs (feedback and monitoring, shaping knowledge, repetition and substitution, and reward).

"Library, Information Science & Technology Abstracts",lxh,141902553,Advancing social media derived information messaging and management: A multi-mode development perspective.,"• The research developed a four mode taxonomy for SM development. • A group of project managers recommended a development mode for six diverse firms. • The functional development mode was recommended as suitable for multiple firms. • Firms can employ focused development modes for 'listen and learn' programs. • Groundswell promotions can be integrated with SM best practice and multi-organizational collaborations. With global reach of over 2 billion active users, the evolution of Social Media (SM) systems has provided organizations with sophisticated tools and technologies for delivering business objectives. Importantly, while marketers and public relations experts have taken leading positions in promotion and advancement of SM, project managers are often tasked with delivering SM systems. In this study, a sample of 127 project managers were asked to evaluate and recommend modes of SM development for six diverse firms using a four-part taxonomy. The results show that firms of varying size can employ narrowly focused and low cost SM development modes to meet their business objectives, with well-resourced firms able to use experimental modes to deliver widespread and higher cost 'listen and learn' SM systems. Alternatively, in addition to achieving groundswell promotions and broader business marketing and sales influencing objectives, firms that engage in large scale SM developments can document and implement SM best practices and apply multi-organizational collaborations required for information exchange, customer feedback and experience sharing. These managerial perspectives expose the intrinsic connections between SM systems and information messaging and management within firms.

Although Like and Reaction cues (excluding Angry) were all identified as more literal in meaning than not, specific results indicated: (a) Likes were perceived more faithfully than Reactions; (b) the Like and Love cues were labeled as the most faithful; and (c) Reactions were perceived as more deliberate and less automatic communicative behaviors than Likes.

A systematic review of WhatsApp and its role in civic and political engagement.,"The use of instant messaging platforms such as WhatsApp for civic and political purposes has been observed and reported to be growing faster than other social media platforms especially in recent years. Using empirical research on WhatsApp studies published from 2009 to 2019 as its corpus of data, this article systematically reviews them to provide more robust conclusions about WhatsApp and its relationship with political and/or civic engagement. This paper seeks to answer three central questions related to WhatsApp and engagement: 1) What are the motivations in using WhatsApp and how do they manifest in the use of WhatsApp as a communication tool? 2) What is the role of WhatsApp in civic and political engagement? 3) How do researchers study the use of WhatsApp in civic and political engagement? The review finds that across empirical studies, while WhatsApp is used by activists and organisational networks for mobilisation and coordinating actions, it is also used by users who draw on the affordances of the medium for informal and 'de-politicised' conversations.

To this end, we look at the case of #Unidos Contra o Golpe (United Against the Coup), a WhatsApp ""private group"" which emerged in 2016 in Florianópolis, Brazil, to oppose the controversial impeachment of the then-president Dilma Rousseff. We argue that a new type of political activist is emerging within and alongside with contemporary movements: the WhatsApper, an individual who uses the chat app intensely to serve her political agenda, leveraging its affordances for political participation. We explore WhatsApp as a discursive opportunity structure and investigate the emergence of a repertoire specific to chat apps. We show how recurrent interaction in the app results into an all-purpose, identity-like sense of connectedness binding social actors together. Diffuse leadership and experimental pluralism emerge as the bare organizing principles of these groups. The paper is based on a qualitative analysis of group interactions and conversations, complemented by semi-structured interviews with group members.

Live streaming is a novel form overwhelmingly found amongst young people disproportionately harmed by the economic crisis, and we propose that the contraction of employment opportunities is giving rise to a strong imperative to be seen, which finds an outlet in the practices of self-presentation, self-promotion and entrepreneurial enterprise that are central to financially-successful live streaming. We first outline relevant contemporary economic conditions, the disproportionately high prizes at the top of career paths, the attendant lures of fame and fortune, and how the politics of play have been affected by these changes. We then explore Twitch.tv (the leading game live streaming platform) as our case study, covering how streamers make themselves appealing, market themselves, profit, and how the platform's affordances are interwoven into these questions. In doing so, we present Twitch as illustrative of the broader phenomenon of 'digital celebrity' and argue its practices reflect changes in work opportunities and social identity.

"Library, Information Science & Technology Abstracts",lxh,134543049,On the ethical and political agency of online reputation systems.,"Social and socioeconomic interactions and transactions often require trust. In digital spaces, the main approach to facilitating trust has effectively been to try to reduce or even remove the need for it through the implementation of reputation systems. These generate metrics based on digital data such as ratings and reviews submitted by users, interaction histories, and so on, that are intended to label individuals as more or less reliable or trustworthy in a particular interaction context. We undertake a disclosive archaeology (Introna, 2014) of typical reputation systems, identifying relevant figuration agencies including affordances and prohibitions, (cyborg) identities, (cyborg) practices and discourses, in order to examine their ethico-political agency. We suggest that conventional approaches to the design of such systems are rooted in a capitalist, competitive paradigm, relying on methodological individualism, and that the reputation technologies themselves thus embody and enact this paradigm within whatever space they operate. We question whether the politics, ethics and philosophy that contribute to this paradigm align with those of some of the contexts in which reputation systems are now being used, and suggest that alternative approaches to the establishment of trust and reputation in digital spaces need to be considered for alternative contexts.",20190201,"Wilson, Anna ; De Paoli, Stefano",Article,Academic Journal,Feb2019,true,First Monday,Socioeconomic factors ; Sociodemographic factors ; Social status ; Economic opportunities ; Cyborgs,JOUR,,,1396-0466,,,,,eng,First Monday,1,1,1,24,2,10.5210/fm.v24i2.9393,,DZZ,,https://research.ebsco.com/linkprocessor/plink?id=20988fd5-ed8a-348a-b76f-f6910209e22a

We use data from a hashtag activism campaign, #ILookLikeAnEngineer, launched to showcase diversity within engineering workforce, to examine how different elements of a campaign blend together. We specifically identify three distinct but interconnected ways in which social media supports activism: 1) modality -- it allows users to participate through text, photos, and links; 2) messaging -- it allows users to post and support multiple though related topics; and 3) actors -- it provides a voice to different participants (individuals/organizations, men/women). Our analysis supports the idea that multivocality -- the core idea that people leverage multiple ways of participating -- is the key to campaign success.

Through a representative survey, we compare the influence of a series of socio-demographical variables such as political interest, age, gender and education on the interaction levels between citizens and politicians. The article argues that the social media logic can be operationalized into “connected affordances”: Redistribution, Interacting and Acknowledging — which are the three types of user practices on Facebook and Twitter. The study finds that Facebook is a service where “ordinary” people engage in political interaction with politicians — and receive replies from politicians — while Twitter is mostly used by just a small group of the population for these purposes. Hence, the popularity of Facebook could be seen as allowing for new connections between citizens and politicians without news media as mediators. Our results suggest that the stronger the political interest the citizens express, the more connective affordances are utilized — such as commenting and sharing. Political interest also impacts what response citizens receive from political actors in social media.",20170206,"Kalsnes, Bente ; Larsson, Anders Olof ; Enli, Gunn",Article,Academic Journal,Feb2017,true,First Monday,Political communication ; Facebook (Web resource),JOUR,,,1396-0466,,,,,eng,First Monday,1,1,1,22,2,10.5210/fm.v22i2.6348,,DZZ,,https://research.ebsco.com/linkprocessor/plink?id=85eb7ec6-5aa8-32cc-a0fa-655ea81c0271

A complex picture emerged, where GAFE was perceived both as a neutral, well-functioning tool and as a means of educating in partly new ways. Furthermore, the study shows that GAFE, despite its characteristic of being a non-generative appliance, still can be used in creative ways. The implementation of cloud technology, such as GAFE, endorses a tunnel-vision affordance that downgrades more nuanced perceptions of the different technological, economical, and ethical aspects of the technology.

"Library, Information Science & Technology Abstracts",lxh,128427236,Individual Differences in the Relationship Between Attachment and Nomophobia Among College Students: The Mediating Role of Mindfulness.,"<bold>Background: </bold>There is a growing interest in nomophobia, which is defined as the fear of being out of cellular phone contact, or ""feelings of discomfort or anxiety experienced by individuals when they are unable to use their mobile phones or utilize the affordances these devices provide"". However, only limited research can be found in terms of its determinants at present. Contemporary literature suggests that the relationships among attachment styles, mindfulness, and nomophobia have not been investigated.<bold>Objective: </bold>This study aims to investigate the mediating effect of mindfulness on the relationship between attachment and nomophobia. In addition, the study also focuses on gender differences in attachment, mindfulness, and nomophobia. A theory-based structural model was tested to understand the essentials of the associations between the constructs.<bold>Methods: </bold>The Experiences in Close Relationships Scale, Nomophobia Questionnaire, and Mindful Attention Awareness Scale were used to collect data from undergraduate students (N=450; 70.9% women [319/450]; mean age=21.94 years [SD 3.61]). Two measurement models (ie, attachment and mindfulness) and a structural model were specified, estimated, and evaluated.<bold>Results: </bold>The structural equation model shows that the positive direct effects of avoidant (.13, P=.03) and anxious attachment (.48, P<.001) on nomophobia were significant. The negative direct effects of avoidant (-.18, P=.01) and anxious attachment (-.33, P<.001) on mindfulness were also significant. Moreover, mindfulness has a significant negative effect on nomophobia for women only (-.13, P=.03). Finally, the Sobel test showed that the indirect effects of avoidant and anxious attachment on nomophobia via mindfulness were significant (P<.001). The direct and indirect effects of anxious attachment, avoidant attachment, and mindfulness altogether accounted for 33% of the total variance in nomophobia. Gender comparison results show that there is a significant difference in attachment based on gender (F2,447=6.97, P=.01, Wilk λ=.97, partial η2=.03). Women (mean 68.46 [SD 16.96]) scored significantly higher than men (mean 63.59 [SD 15.97]) in anxious attachment (F1=7.93, P=.01, partial η2=.02). Gender differences in mindfulness were not significant (F4,448=3.45, P=.69). On the other hand, results do show significant gender differences in nomophobia (F4,445=2.71, P=.03, Wilk λ=.98, partial η2=.02) where women scored significantly higher than men.<bold>Conclusions: </bold>In general, individuals who are emotionally more dependent and crave more closeness and attention in the relationship tend to display higher levels of fear or discomfort when they have no access to their mobile phones. However, gender has a differential impact on the relationship between avoidant attachment and nomophobia. This study establishes the impact of mindfulness on nomophobia for women; therefore, future studies should test the effectiveness of mindfulness-based therapy approaches and confirm whether they are effective and efficient. On the basis of significant gender difference in nomophobia and attachment, we conclude that gender should be taken into account in mindfulness-based treatments dealing with nomophobia.",20171201,"Arpaci, Ibrahim ; Baloğlu, Mustafa ; Kozan, Hatice İrem Özteke ; Kesici, Şahin",Article,Academic Journal,Dec2017,true,Journal of Medical Internet Research,Students ; Anxiety ; Phobias ; Mindfulness ; Psychology,JOUR,,,1439-4456,,,,,eng,JMIR Publications Inc.,271,1,271,19,12,10.2196/jmir.8847,,DNC,,https://research.ebsco.com/linkprocessor/plink?id=55bd0330-75f4-3c61-aab4-b5c42170e8a9
"Library, Information Science & Technology Abstracts",lxh,103129423,Vaccination Persuasion Online: A Qualitative Study of Two Provaccine and Two Vaccine-Skeptical Websites.,"Background: Current concerns about vaccination resistance often cite the Internet as a source of vaccine controversy. Most academic studies of vaccine resistance online use quantitative methods to describe misinformation on vaccine-skeptical websites. Findings from these studies are useful for categorizing the generic features of these websites, but they do not provide insights into why these websites successfully persuade their viewers. To date, there have been few attempts to understand, qualitatively, the persuasive features of provaccine or vaccine-skeptical websites. Objective: The purpose of this research was to examine the persuasive features of provaccine and vaccine-skeptical websites. The qualitative analysis was conducted to generate hypotheses concerning what features of these websites are persuasive to people seeking information about vaccination and vaccine-related practices. Methods: This study employed a fully qualitative case study methodology that used the anthropological method of thick description to detail and carefully review the rhetorical features of 1 provaccine government website, 1 provaccine hospital website, 1 vaccine-skeptical information website focused on general vaccine safety, and 1 vaccine-skeptical website focused on a specific vaccine. The data gathered were organized into 5 domains: website ownership, visual and textual content, user experience, hyperlinking, and social interactivity. Results: The study found that the 2 provaccine websites analyzed functioned as encyclopedias of vaccine information. Both of the websites had relatively small digital ecologies because they only linked to government websites or websites that endorsed vaccination and evidence-based medicine. Neither of these websites offered visitors interactive features or made extensive use of the affordances of Web 2.0. The study also found that the 2 vaccine-skeptical websites had larger digital ecologies because they linked to a variety of vaccine-related websites, including government websites. They leveraged the affordances of Web 2.0 with their interactive features and digital media. Conclusions: By employing a rhetorical framework, this study found that the provaccine websites analyzed concentrate on the accurate transmission of evidence-based scientific research about vaccines and government-endorsed vaccination-related practices, whereas the vaccine-skeptical websites focus on creating communities of people affected by vaccines and vaccine-related practices. From this personal framework, these websites then challenge the information presented in scientific literature and government documents. At the same time, the vaccine-skeptical websites in this study are repositories of vaccine information and vaccination-related resources. Future studies on vaccination and the Internet should take into consideration the rhetorical features of provaccine and vaccine-skeptical websites and further investigate the influence of Web 2.0 community-building features on people seeking information about vaccine-related practices.",20150501,"Grant, Lenny ; Hausman, Bernice L ; Cashion, Margaret ; Lucchesi, Nicholas ; Patel, Kelsey ; Roberts, Jonathan",Article,Academic Journal,May2015,true,Journal of Medical Internet Research,Medical informatics ; Internet in medicine ; Vaccination ; Social media in medicine ; Telemedicine,JOUR,,,1439-4456,,,,,eng,JMIR Publications Inc.,1,1,1,17,5,10.2196/jmir.4153,,DNC,,https://research.ebsco.com/linkprocessor/plink?id=b4fa47c3-a85d-3a1a-94d4-08824abce642

Despite the increased use of the Web for health-related information, we need to question whether the Web and the ease of seeking health information that it provides leads to more (patient) empowerment. As well as being a time of joy and expectations, pregnancy can be a worrying time for women, especially first time mums-to-be, with unfamiliar experiences and symptoms and concerns for the baby as well as the self.<bold>Objective: </bold>Our aim was to explore how and why pregnant women use the Web to gain information and support during pregnancy and what they consider a reliable source.<bold>Methods: </bold>To meet the objectives of the study, a qualitative approach was required to gather information on the experiences of currently pregnant women who use the Web to gain information and support during their pregnancy. Sixteen pregnant women took part in a semistructured interview, either face-to-face or via telephone. The interviews took place from January to March 2016, all participants were from England, and the health professionals are all employed by the National Health Service (NHS). Qualitative analytical procedures were employed using inductive thematic analysis supported by NVivo software (QSR International).<bold>Results: </bold>Pregnant women found reassurance from the experiences of others. This reassurance resulted in them feeling less alone, as well as enabling them to normalize any symptoms or experiences they were undergoing. The women understood that caution was needed at times while reading the stories of others, acknowledging the potential for extreme cases or worst case scenarios. This is particularly pertinent to the Web, as this wide range of stories may not be as easily accessible if stories where confined to those in a woman's offline social circle. The interviews provide insights into how and why pregnant women search online for information and perhaps more so, support while pregnant.<bold>Conclusions: </bold>Searching for health information and advice online during pregnancy is viewed as quick, easy, and accessible. The affordances of the Web have provided women the opportunity to go online as a first port of call. Knowing they were not alone and reading the experiences or symptoms of other pregnant women enabled women to normalize their experience and was ultimately reassuring for pregnant women.",20170601,"Prescott, Julie ; Mackie, Lynn",journal article,Academic Journal,Jun2017,true,Journal of Medical Internet Research,Medical informatics ; Websites ; Online information services ; Internet ; Qualitative research ; Information-seeking behavior ; Pregnant women ; National health services ; Evaluation of medical care ; Pregnancy ; Telemedicine,JOUR,,,1439-4456,,,,,eng,JMIR Publications Inc.,1,1,1,19,6,10.2196/jmir.6302,,DNC,,https://research.ebsco.com/linkprocessor/plink?id=b5227438-855c-3020-8560-98ebebd8cfce

Trust is an important component of peer-to-peer support, although relatively little is known about how trust forms within online health forums.<bold>Objective: </bold>The aim of this paper is to examine how trust develops and influences sharing among users of an online breast cancer forum.<bold>Methods: </bold>An interpretive qualitative approach was adopted. Data were collected from forum posts from 135 threads on 9 boards on the UK charity, Breast Cancer Care (BCC). Semistructured interviews were conducted with 14 BCC forum users. Both datasets were analyzed thematically using Braun and Clarke's approach and combined to triangulate analysis.<bold>Results: </bold>Trust operates in 3 dimensions, structural, relational, and temporal, and these intersect with each other and do not operate in isolation. The structural dimension relates to how the affordances and formal rules of the site affected trust. The relational dimension refers to how trust was necessarily experienced in interactions with other forum users: it emerged within relationships and was a social phenomenon. The temporal dimension relates to how trust changed over time and was influenced by the length of time users spent on the forum.<bold>Conclusions: </bold>Trust is a process that changes over time and which is influenced by structural features of the forum, as well as informal but collectively understood relational interactions among forum users.

"Library, Information Science & Technology Abstracts",lxh,100322373,Educational Technologies in Problem-Based Learning in Health Sciences Education: A Systematic Review.,"Background: As a modern pedagogical philosophy, problem-based learning (PBL) is increasingly being recognized as a major research area in student learning and pedagogical innovation in health sciences education. A new area of research interest has been the role of emerging educational technologies in PBL. Although this field is growing, no systematic reviews of studies of the usage and effects of educational technologies in PBL in health sciences education have been conducted to date. Objective: The aim of this paper is to review new and emerging educational technologies in problem-based curricula, with a specific focus on 3 cognate clinical disciplines: medicine, dentistry, and speech and hearing sciences. Analysis of the studies reviewed focused on the effects of educational technologies in PBL contexts while addressing the particular issue of scaffolding of student learning. Methods: A comprehensive computerized database search of full-text articles published in English from 1996 to 2014 was carried out using 3 databases: ProQuest, Scopus, and EBSCOhost. Eligibility criteria for selection of studies for review were also determined in light of the population, intervention, comparison, and outcomes (PICO) guidelines. The population was limited to postsecondary education, specifically in dentistry, medicine, and speech and hearing sciences, in which PBL was the key educational pedagogy and curriculum design. Three types of educational technologies were identified as interventions used to support student inquiry: learning software and digital learning objects; interactive whiteboards (IWBs) and plasma screens; and learning management systems (LMSs). Results: Of 470 studies, 28 were selected for analysis. Most studies examined the effects of learning software and digital learning objects (n=20) with integration of IWB (n=5) and LMS (n=3) for PBL receiving relatively less attention. The educational technologies examined in these studies were seen as potentially fit for problem-based health sciences education. Positive outcomes for student learning included providing rich, authentic problems and/or case contexts for learning; supporting student development of medical expertise through the accessing and structuring of expert knowledge and skills; making disciplinary thinking and strategies explicit; providing a platform to elicit articulation, collaboration, and reflection; and reducing perceived cognitive load. Limitations included cumbersome scenarios, infrastructure requirements, and the need for staff and student support in light of the technological demands of new affordances. Conclusions: This literature review demonstrates the generally positive effect of educational technologies in PBL. Further research into the various applications of educational technology in PBL curricula is needed to fully realize its potential to enhance problem-based approaches in health sciences education.",20141201,"Jin, Jun ; Bridges, Susan M",Article,Academic Journal,Dec2014,true,Journal of Medical Internet Research,Educational technology ; Medical science education ; Problem-based learning ; Meta-analysis ; Learning management system ; Medical education,JOUR,,,1439-4456,,,,,eng,JMIR Publications Inc.,1,1,1,16,12,10.2196/jmir.3240,,DNC,,https://research.ebsco.com/linkprocessor/plink?id=c9b5361c-6c4e-34e6-9c91-d9a4e472e2b5
"Library, Information Science & Technology Abstracts",lxh,96528200,Death and the Internet: The implications of the digital afterlife.,"This paper addresses the ways in which our cultural understanding of death is changed by the digital afterlife and the affordances of the Internet. Since the advent of the digital age, we now interact, create and conduct business online leaving a digital footprint that remains even after we die; there is now a growing popular cultural awareness of this and online start--ups have been quick to capitalise on our need to make for provision for our digital assets. Social platforms have al lowed for Web memorialisation, emergence of new grieving practices and expansion of traditional mourning rituals, however, there are a number of issues related to digital assets and these online mourning practices. At present, there is no consensus as to how social media company policies on deceased user accounts are handled, an area that is further muddied by legal issues of ownership and privacy. Furthermore user interface design does not currently make provision for the death of users and the social processes around online mourning were found to be complex and at times damaging to the bereaved. The expansion of our digital lives, the end of 'sequestered death', new mourning practices and issues associated with these changes, have, this paper argues, expanded, changed, and irreversibly complicated our cultural understanding of death as mediated through the Internet and communication technologies.",20140602,"Wright, Nicola",Article,Academic Journal,Jun2014,true,First Monday,Social aspects of death ; Digital technology & society ; Internet & society ; Grief ; Social media research,JOUR,,,1396-0466,,,,,eng,First Monday,1,1,1,19,6,10.5210/fm.v19i6.4998,,DZZ,,https://research.ebsco.com/linkprocessor/plink?id=0d1c6a99-afa3-3884-865b-9398a7ec5148
"Library, Information Science & Technology Abstracts",lxh,103928072,Web-based virtual patients in nursing education: development and validation of theory-anchored design and activity models.,"<bold>Background: </bold>Research has shown that nursing students find it difficult to translate and apply their theoretical knowledge in a clinical context. Virtual patients (VPs) have been proposed as a learning activity that can support nursing students in their learning of scientific knowledge and help them integrate theory and practice. Although VPs are increasingly used in health care education, they still lack a systematic consistency that would allow their reuse outside of their original context. There is therefore a need to develop a model for the development and implementation of VPs in nursing education.<bold>Objective: </bold>The aim of this study was to develop and evaluate a virtual patient model optimized to the learning and assessment needs in nursing education.<bold>Methods: </bold>The process of modeling started by reviewing theoretical frameworks reported in the literature and used by practitioners when designing learning and assessment activities. The Outcome-Present State Test (OPT) model was chosen as the theoretical framework. The model was then, in an iterative manner, developed and optimized to the affordances of virtual patients. Content validation was performed with faculty both in terms of the relevance of the chosen theories but also its applicability in nursing education. The virtual patient nursing model was then instantiated in two VPs. The students' perceived usefulness of the VPs was investigated using a questionnaire. The result was analyzed using descriptive statistics.<bold>Results: </bold>A virtual patient Nursing Design Model (vpNDM) composed of three layers was developed. Layer 1 contains the patient story and ways of interacting with the data, Layer 2 includes aspects of the iterative process of clinical reasoning, and finally Layer 3 includes measurable outcomes. A virtual patient Nursing Activity Model (vpNAM) was also developed as a guide when creating VP-centric learning activities. The students perceived the global linear VPs as a relevant learning activity for the integration of theory and practice.<bold>Conclusions: </bold>Virtual patients that are adapted to the nursing paradigm can support nursing students' development of clinical reasoning skills. The proposed virtual patient nursing design and activity models will allow the systematic development of different types of virtual patients from a common model and thereby create opportunities for sharing pedagogical designs across technical solutions.",20140401,"Georg, Carina ; Zary, Nabil",journal article,Academic Journal,Apr2014,true,Journal of Medical Internet Research,,JOUR,,,1439-4456,,,,,eng,JMIR Publications Inc.,11,e105,,16,4,10.2196/jmir.2556,,DNC,,https://research.ebsco.com/linkprocessor/plink?id=ac29929b-e265-31a0-9d6c-dd79a9cb340b
"Library, Information Science & Technology Abstracts",lxh,89624134,How Twitter Is Studied in the Medical Professions: A Classification of Twitter Papers Indexed in PubMed.,"Background: Since their inception, Twitter and related microblogging systems have provided a rich source of information for researchers and have attracted interest in their affordances and use. Since 2009 PubMed has included 123 journal articles on medicine and Twitter, but no overview exists as to how the field uses Twitter in research. Objective: This paper aims to identify published work relating to Twitter within the fields indexed by PubMed, and then to classify it. This classification will provide a framework in which future researchers will be able to position their work, and to provide an understanding of the current reach of research using Twitter in medical disciplines. Methods: Papers on Twitter and related topics were identified and reviewed. The papers were then qualitatively classified based on the paper's title and abstract to determine their focus. The work that was Twitter focused was studied in detail to determine what data, if any, it was based on, and from this a categorization of the data set size used in the studies was developed. Using open coded content analysis additional important categories were also identified, relating to the primary methodology, domain, and aspect. Results: As of 2012, PubMed comprises more than 21 million citations from biomedical literature, and from these a corpus of 134 potentially Twitter related papers were identified, eleven of which were subsequently found not to be relevant. There were no papers prior to 2009 relating to microblogging, a term first used in 2006. Of the remaining 123 papers which mentioned Twitter, thirty were focused on Twitter (the others referring to it tangentially). The early Twitter focused papers introduced the topic and highlighted the potential, not carrying out any form of data analysis. The majority of published papers used analytic techniques to sort through thousands, if not millions, of individual tweets, often depending on automated tools to do so. Our analysis demonstrates that researchers are starting to use knowledge discovery methods and data mining techniques to understand vast quantities of tweets: the study of Twitter is becoming quantitative research. Conclusions: This work is to the best of our knowledge the first overview study of medical related research based on Twitter and related microblogging. We have used 5 dimensions to categorize published medical related research on Twitter. This classification provides a framework within which researchers studying development and use of Twitter within medical related research, and those undertaking comparative studies of research, relating to Twitter in the area of medicine and beyond, can position and ground their work.

"Library, Information Science & Technology Abstracts",lxh,89188912,Zooming into an Instragram City: Reading the local through social media.,"How are users' experiences of production, sharing, and interaction with the media they create mediated by the interfaces of particular social media platforms? How can we use computational analysis and visualizations of the content of visual social media (e.g., user photos, as opposed to upload dates, locations, tags and other metadata) to study social and cultural patterns? How can we visualize this media on multiple spatial and temporal scales? In this paper, we examine these questions through the analysis of the popular mobile photo--sharing application Instagram. First, we analyze the affordances provided by the Instagram interface and the ways this interface and the application's tools structure users' understanding and use of the ""Instagram medium."" Next, we compare the visual signatures of 13 different global cities using 2.3 million Instagram photos from these cities. Finally, we use spatio--temporal visualizations of over 200,000 Instagram photos uploaded in Tel Aviv, Israel over three months to show how they can offer social, cultural and political insights about people's activities in particular locations and time periods.",20130701,"Hochman, Nadav ; Manovich, Lev",Article,Academic Journal,Jul2013,true,First Monday,Social media ; Internet users ; Metadata ; Mobile apps ; Online social networks,JOUR,,,1396-0466,,,,,eng,First Monday,9,9,1,18,7,10.5210/fm.v18i7.4711,,DZZ,,https://research.ebsco.com/linkprocessor/plink?id=34b38bb7-281c-3885-a245-f973e3232a51

Much less is known about the use of SNSs beyond the individual level and outside of the American context. This study fills in the gaps by offering insight into the personified use of interactive features on SNSs by organizations in China for branding purposes. Based on the notion of the social affordances of technologies, we conducted a content analysis of the presence and activities of 98 organizations on a popular Chinese SNS and identified 15 interactive features, including profile related features (e.g., status updates, discussion board, message forwarding) and social game related features (e.g., game players, raffles, virtual goods). The results of our statistical analysis indicated that the more interactive features that an organization used, the more page visits and fans it attracted and the more electronic word of mouth (eWOM) behavior occurred. All of these interactive features helped personify the organizations as friends to their fans, followers, service users, and potential customers, which created a new form of organization--public communication: sharing as ""frands.""",20120501,Hua Wang ; Jingbo Meng ; Fan Dong,Article,Academic Journal,May2012,true,First Monday,Content analysis ; Computer network resources ; China ; Online social networks research ; Branding (Marketing) ; Interactive marketing ; Public relations ; Nongovernmental organizations ; Interpersonal communication,JOUR,,,1396-0466,,,,,eng,First Monday,2,2,1,17,5,10.5210/fm.v17i5.3718,,DZZ,,https://research.ebsco.com/linkprocessor/plink?id=40828029-ad5c-3dbe-a825-27d5d3273080

"Library, Information Science & Technology Abstracts",lxh,59526904,Hacking and power: Social and technological determinism in the digital age.,"This article outlines the nature of hacking and then draws implications from this for understandings of technology and society in the digital age. Hacking is analysed as having a material practice related to computers and networks taken up by two core groups: crackers who break into other people’s computers and network and the free software and open source who produce software based on an understanding of property as distribution. Hacking works constantly to develop determinations between technology and society in both directions. This conclusion is then theorised in relation to Hutchby’s concept of affordances and is compared to classic accounts of technological determinism. Accounts of technology and society in the digital age need to consider both technological and social determinations, that such determinations are particularly fluid in relation to programming and that understanding power and politics in relation technology needs a concept of technological and determination.",20090701,"Jordan, Tim",Article,Academic Journal,Jul2009,true,First Monday,Computer hacking ; Open source software ; Power (Philosophy) ; Technology & society,JOUR,,,1396-0466,,,,,eng,First Monday,1,1,1,14,7,10.5210/fm.v14i7.2417,,DZZ,,https://research.ebsco.com/linkprocessor/plink?id=291934f6-3758-3faf-a219-808c1d3e0a8f

After considering the affordances of Web 2.0 technologies vs Web 1.0 technologies and a framework for viewing social software in terms of groups, networks and collectives, we describe an instance of trying to use Elgg, a rich social application, to support a distance-taught course within a conventional face-to-face university. A number of issues are identified, some of which are related to Elgg's interface but the biggest of which relate to the tensions between top-down and bottom-up control and the shifting contexts of personal, group, network and collective modes of engagement. These problems suggest that, in their current form, social technologies pose intractable difficulties in information organisation and retrieval when used for formal learning. We propose a range of solutions that make use of the wisdom of the crowd combined with human intervention.

"Library, Information Science & Technology Abstracts",lxh,31651948,Flickr: a first look at user behaviour in the context of photography as serious leisure.,"Introduction. The use of Flickr, a photo sharing Website, is examined in the context of amateur photography as a 'serious leisure' pursuit. Method. Eleven telephone interviews were carried out with users of Flickr, using an open-ended interview schedule to explore use of the system within the context of the interviewees' photographic practices. Analysis. Practices described are set against theoretical considerations from the literature, specifically the alternate paradigms of the photographic club and the photo magazine. Sontag's cultural critique of photography is an important, challenging reference point. Results. The affordances of the system affect the satisfactions of hobby photography. Flickr creates moral dilemmas, such as whether to reciprocate comments or tag the photos of others. The system's appeal lies in its moral qualities as much as whether it is easy to use or performs functions efficiently. Flickr draws users into the hobby and so, like the camera club or the magazine, can be linked to the interests of industry. Yet it is too pessimistic to see it as simply a vehicle of consumerist culture; users expressed almost unqualified satisfaction with the system for its direct pleasures and learning opportunities. Conclusions. The fluid social relations of Flickr potentially free the hobby from the rather restrictive codes and ordering of the photographic club.",20080301,"Cox, A. M. ; Clough, P.

Yes or no?’ This question, while fundamentally odd, is a key component of social network sites. Participants must select who on the system they deem to be ‘Friends.’ Their choice is publicly displayed for all to see and becomes the backbone for networked participation. By examining what different participants groups do on social network sites, this paper investigates what Friendship means and how Friendship affects the culture of the sites. I will argue that Friendship helps people write community into being in social network sites. Through these imagined egocentric communities, participants are able to express who they are and locate themselves culturally. In turn, this provides individuals with a contextual frame through which they can properly socialize with other participants. Friending is deeply affected by both social processes and technological affordances. I will argue that the established Friending norms evolved out of a need to resolve the social tensions that emerged due to technological limitations. At the same time, I will argue that Friending supports pre-existing social norms yet because the architecture of social network sites is fundamentally different than the architecture of unmediated social spaces, these sites introduce an environment that is quite unlike that with which we are accustomed.",20061201,"Boyd, Danah",Article,Academic Journal,Dec2006,true,First Monday,Friendship ; Social groups ; Social networks ; Social conflict ; Social control,JOUR,,,1396-0466,,,,,eng,First Monday,1,1,1,,12,,,DZZ,,https://research.ebsco.com/linkprocessor/plink?id=58295165-cfad-3a57-b2c9-1bfc7307f628

The instructors were part of a pilot project at a Canadian university involving the integration of a synchronous communication and collaboration environment into asynchronous distance education courses. To establish their bearings, the instructors need to be aware of their goals and combine them with strategies and techniques that effectively manage the affordances and constraints of the environment. That process may require a degree of risk-taking combined with a willingness to help students lead themselves.

The students were selected from the Department of Geography Education at Marmara University in Istanbul. The DML scale was used to collect the data from the students. The data, including students' perceptions were analyzed and compared according to their experience levels (expert or naive) on map literacy and computer literacy. Students were classified as expert and naive on map literacy and computer literacy based on their own expression on the scale. Also, the DML perceptions of the student groups have been compared with three different perspectives: (1) cultural-aesthetical dimension: visual perception, (2) technical-informational dimension: functional perception, (3) geographical-social dimension: map perception. The data obtained has been transferred to statistics SPSS software and the findings have been analyzed within these data. At the scope of Encarta Reference Library 2003 application program, the groups' perceptions have been compared with X² test on a single item base and independent t- test samples in general. The results showed that there are no significant differences between the expert and the naive student groups' perceptions on the DML at 0.05 level of significance. The groups' perceptions bounded with literacy experience are the same in the digital atlas utilization on the web. Based on the Digital Map Literacy scale, it can be said that the Microsoft Encarta digital atlas provides affordance, visibility, utility, functionality, ease of use, and simplicity to the naives and the experts geography students.
